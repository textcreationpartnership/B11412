            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow grieuous a burden <hi>sinne</hi> is, you may well perceiue, by the heauy punishments, which God layeth vpon the committers of <hi>sinne.</hi> Good store of examples the first chapter of this prophecie hath yeelded vnto you. The <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites</hi> haue for their sinnes bin seuerally repayed with vengeance from Heauen; the fire of the wrath of God hath seized vpon them, and devoured them; their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1741:4"/> Cities are become desolate; their memorie is perished from off the earth. As it is befallen them, so it befalleth the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> also: against whom <hi>Amos</hi> in the beginning of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter directeth his prophecie: and to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, whereto the prophecies of the former Chapter were directed.</p>
               <p>The<note n="a" place="margin">See my sixth Lecture vpon Amos 1.</note> reasons why <hi>Amos,</hi> sent of purpose with a message to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> doth prophecie against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philistins,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites,</hi> all forreine nations, are three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he might be the more patiently heard of his countrymen, the <hi>Israelites.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> seeing their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> so sharpe against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, could not but with more quiet heare him, when he should prophecie against them also. <hi>Consolatio quaedam est afflictio inimici:</hi> Some comfort it is to a distressed naturall man, to see his enemie in distresse likewise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they might haue no cause to wonder, if God should at any time come against them in vengeance, seeing that he would not spare the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other their neighbor countries, though they were destitute of the light of Gods word, and ignorant of his will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they might the more tremble at the words of this prophecie, when they should see the <hi>Syrians</hi> and other Nations affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>ities.</p>
               <p>Here might the <hi>Israelites</hi> thus haue argued: Will not God spare the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Moabites?</hi> Then out of doubt he will not spare vs. They silly people neuer knew the holy will of God, and yet shall they be so seuerely punished? How then shall we escape; who knowing Gods holy will, haue contemned it?</p>
               <p>You see now, why <hi>Amos</hi> sent with a message to the Ten Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> doth first prophecie against foreine Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the last place are the <hi>Moabites.</hi> This prophecie against the <hi>Moabites, Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> in their transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1741:4"/> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> do add to the first Chapter, as a part of it. But sith the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text so diuides it not, I will not follow them: but will expound it, as belonging to the second Chapter.</p>
               <p>The words then which I haue read vnto you, are the burden of <hi>Moab;</hi> a heauy prophecie against <hi>Moab.</hi> And doe conteine three generall parts.</p>

               <p>Thus haue you the Analysis, resolution, or diuision of my Text. Returne we now to the Preface: <hi>Thus saith the Lord;</hi> whose name in my Text is <hi>Iehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sundry are the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in holy Scripture; by which albeit the <hi>substance of God</hi> cannot aptly, and clearely be defined, yet they serue vs thus farre; to bring vs to some further knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> then otherwise we should haue. These Names of <hi>God</hi> are obserued by ancient Diuines to be of two sorts, Negatiue, and Affirmatiue.</p>
               <p>The negatiue Names of <hi>God,</hi> are <hi>Vncreated, Incorporeall, Invisible, Incorruptible, Infinite,</hi> and such like: and these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe not, what <hi>God</hi> is; but what he is not; and doe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare vnto vs, that he is <hi>bonum quoddam excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimum,</hi> some most excellent <hi>Good,</hi> free from all imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any creature.</p>
               <p>The affirmatiue Names of <hi>God,</hi> are ascribed vnto him either essentially, or by way of relation, or by a Metaphor. The Names of <hi>God</hi> ascribed vnto him essentially, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper to him alone, or common to others also. Among the essentiall Names of <hi>God,</hi> proper to him alone, is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the Name of <hi>God</hi> in my Text. His other es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall Names communicable vnto others, as to men, doe yet belong vnto <hi>God,</hi> either <hi>modo excellentiae,</hi> by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie: or <hi>modo causae independentis;</hi> as he is the primarie cause of all things. By an excellencie, <hi>God</hi> is said to bee <hi>Good, Iust, Wise, Mighty, Holy, Mercifull:</hi> and as he is the primarie cause of all things, so is he called a <hi>Creator,</hi> a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> and hath other like appellations.</p>
               <p>Now the affirmatiue Names of <hi>God,</hi> ascribed vnto him by way of relation, are the Names of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> in which there is no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no cōmeation, no vnion; each person hath his proper name <hi>Father, Son,</hi> &amp; <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> The other affirmatiue Names of God ascribed vnto him by a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, are affirmed of him either <hi>per</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1741:5"/> euery man may vnderstand what they meane: as when <hi>God</hi> is said to be <hi>Angrie;</hi> or <hi>per</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Of these many Names of <hi>God,</hi> now repeated vnto you, his most proper Name is his Name in my Text: his Name <hi>Iehouah,</hi> a Name that cannot be attributed to any creature in the world, no not by an analogie, or similitude. It is the honourablest Name belonging to the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

                  </note> in all tongues, and languages generally consisteth of foure let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and they obserue these foure letters in <hi>Hebrew</hi> to bee <hi>letters of rest,</hi> to signifie vnto vs, that the rest, repose, and tranquillitie of all the Creatures in the world, is in <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: they teach, that it is a powerfull name for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miracles, and that by it <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> haue done great wonders. But these their braine-sicke, superstitious, and blasphemous inventions, my tongue shall not enlarge. Yet thus much I say of this Name, that there is a secret in it. It is plaine <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. There thus saith the <hi>Lord</hi> vnto <hi>Moses: I appeared vnto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Iacob, by the name of a strong, omnipotent, and all-sufficient God, but by my name IEHOVAH was I not knowne to them.</hi> This secret I haue heretofore vnfolded vnto you after this manner.</p>
               <p>This great name of <hi>God,</hi> this name <hi>Iehovah;</hi> first it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth the eternitie of Gods essence in himselfe, that he is <hi>yesterday,</hi> and <hi>to day,</hi> and <hi>the same for euer; which was, which is,</hi> and <hi>which is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it noteth the existence and perfection of all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1741:6"/> things in <hi>God,</hi> as from whom all creatures in the world haue their life, motion, and being. <hi>God</hi> is the being of all his creatures; not that they are the same, that he is, but because <hi>of him,</hi> and <hi>in him,</hi> and <hi>by him are all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the <hi>Memoriall</hi> of God vnto all ages, as himselfe calls it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.15. The <hi>Memoriall</hi> of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, his truth, and his constancie in the performance of his promises. And therefore whensoeuer in any of the Prophets God promiseth, or threatneth, any great matter, to assure vs of the most certaine euent of such his promise, or threatning, he adds vnto it his name <hi>Iehovah:</hi> as here in my text: <hi>Thus saith Iehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iehovah.]</hi> The strength of <hi>Israel:</hi> who is not as man, that he should lye, nor as the sonne of man that he should repent. Wicked <hi>Balaam</hi> is driuen to confesse as much, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. and there proceedeth by way of question: <hi>Hath the Lord said, and shall he not doe it? Hath he spoken and shall he not accomplish it? Samuel</hi> with boldnes tells <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. that the <hi>Lord,</hi> who is <hi>the strength of Israel will not lye nor repent;</hi> and he giues this reason of it: <hi>For he is not a man that he should repent.</hi> All his words, yea all the titles of all his words are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> so firmely ratified, that they cannot be altered; so standing immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they cannot be changed. Our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> giues record herevnto. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24 35. <hi>Coelum &amp; terra prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teribunt.</hi> Heauen and Earth shall passe away; but Gods words, they shall not passe away. The grasse withereth, saith the Prophet <hi>Esay cap.</hi> 40.8. <hi>The grasse withereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus are we by this name <hi>Iehovah</hi> led to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the truth of God. Gods <hi>truth</hi> is his essentiall proprietie, whereby he is most free from all shew or shadow of falshood. This his truth is eminent <hi>in himselfe,</hi> in <hi>his workes,</hi> and <hi>in his words. In himselfe,</hi> two manner of wayes. 1. In respect of his essence, whereby he truly is. 2. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as he is the Idea, type, and patterne of all the <hi>truth</hi> that is in any creature.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1741:6"/>
               <p>Now concerning the workes of God, they all are <hi>Truth?</hi> whether they be <hi>Internall,</hi> or <hi>Externall.</hi> His <hi>Internall workes</hi> are either <hi>personall,</hi> or <hi>essentiall:</hi> and both nothing but <hi>truth.</hi> For his personall workes: the <hi>Father</hi> doth <hi>truly beget</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> is <hi>truly begotten</hi> of the <hi>Father:</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> doth <hi>truly proceed</hi> from the <hi>Father:</hi> and the <hi>Sonne:</hi> the like must we say of his <hi>essentiall workes;</hi> Whatsoeuer God hath decreed, he hath <hi>truly</hi> decreed it, and doth <hi>truly</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it.</p>
               <p>Besides these <hi>Internall workes</hi> of God, some <hi>workes</hi> of his are called in the Schooles <hi>Externall.</hi> Such are the creation of the world, the conseruation of the same, the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, the couenant with the faithfull, and the like, in all which, most constant is the <hi>truth</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>truth</hi> of God is eminent <hi>in himselfe,</hi> and <hi>in his workes,</hi> so also is it eminent <hi>in his words.</hi> This hath but now, bin prooued vnto you by the confession of <hi>Balaam,</hi> by the asseueration of <hi>Samuel,</hi> by the record of the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> and of our Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> I shut vp this doctrine of the <hi>truth</hi> of God, with the words of the blessed Apostle S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Let God be true, and euery man a lyar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs see what vses may be made of this doctrine.</p>
               <p>Is it true?</p>
               <p>Is God <hi>truth</hi> in himselfe, in his works and in his words?</p>
               <p>Hereby may euery childe of God among vs be well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that our faith in God the <hi>Father,</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> his <hi>Sonne,</hi> and in the holy <hi>Ghost,</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> is most true and most certaine: and cannot by any meanes be deceiued it selfe, or deceiue vs? For it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and supported, vpon, and by the words of him, who onely is the <hi>true</hi> God, yea <hi>truth</hi> it selfe: who hath <hi>truly</hi> sayd concerning vs, and all other, who beleeue in <hi>Christ,</hi> that he hath<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37.</note> loued vs<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4.</note> before the foundation of the world, hath chosen vs to eternall life; for our better atteining whereof, he hath<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</note> sent into the world his owne <hi>Sonne</hi> in the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of sinfull flesh;<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.4.</note> made of a woman, and made vnder the Law, that by his<note n="f" place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7.</note>
                  <hi>bloud</hi> we might be clensed from all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1741:7"/> sinne, and<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9.</note> iustifyed in the sight of God: that by his holy spirit we might be<note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</note> regenerated, gouerned, defended from our enemies; and at that great day, the day of the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all flesh, we may both bodie and soule be brought into the full possession of eternall life.</p>
               <p>Which being so, what remaineth on our parts, but that we abide constantly in our holy faith, and perseuere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, euen vnto the end? Without perseuerance our faith will not auaile vs. For not euery one, but such onely as are <hi>marked in their foreheads</hi> with the letter <hi>Tau,</hi> with the note of perfection, and perseuerance, shall enter the inheritance of the blessed. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9 4. And not euery one, but <hi>he</hi> onely, that <hi>endureth to the end shall be saued.</hi> Matth. 10.22. And not euery one, but he onely which is <hi>faithfull vnto death,</hi> shall receiue the <hi>crowne of life.</hi> Reuel. 2.10.</p>
               <p>Let the <hi>dog returne to his vomit,</hi> and the <hi>washed sow to her wallowing in the mire,</hi> as the Prouerbs are. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. But let vs hold fast our holy faith, till it shall please God to call vs to make our finall account, how we haue spent the dayes of our Pilgrimage in this present world. So shall he, that is holy, and true; who hath<note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.7.</note> the key of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which openeth and no man shutteth; which shutteth, and no man open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; open vnto vs the gates of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is aboue, and giue vs full fruition of euerlasting happinesse.</p>
               <p>Thus haue you the first vse of my first doctrine, touching the truth of God. My doctrine was:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God is truth in himselfe, in his workes, and in his words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first vse concerneth our faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance therein. A second followeth.</p>
               <p>It appertaineth to thankesgiuing. For if our saluation, and eternall life doe depend vpon the knowledge of the heauenly <hi>truth;</hi> and God brings none to the knowledge of this <hi>truth</hi> but his elect, and chosen people; how great thankes ought we to giue vnto God, not onely for choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vs, but also for making it knowne vnto vs by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his <hi>truth,</hi> that we are his chosen people. For he hath not onely imprinted in the vs image of that <hi>truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1741:7"/> which is eternall in himselfe; but also daily bringeth vs to such a measure of knowledge of that his heauenly <hi>truth</hi> wherein consisteth our saluation, that we may be saued.</p>
               <p>What greater benefit can there be vnto vs, then this? What more ample testimonie of his eternall good will to vs? For this benefit, that is, for the knowledge of Gods heauenly <hi>truth,</hi> the blessed Apostle S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> neuer ceased to giue thanks vnto God. I thanke God (saith he 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.) I <hi>thanke him, who hath made me strong, that is, Christ Iesus our Lord: for he counted me faithfull, and put me in his seruice;</hi> When <hi>before I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor, but I was receiued to mercy.</hi> From this his thankefull heart proceeded those his words, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Doubtlesse, <hi>I thinke all things but losse, for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I haue counted all things losse, and doe iudge them to be but</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, euen <hi>dung, that I might winne Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> charitie was not confined within the Temple of his owne bodie; others had a tast thereof. As the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> to whom in his first Epistle, cap. 1. ver. 4. he thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth his affection: <hi>I thanke my God alwayes on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, for the grace of God which is giuen you in Iesus Christ, that in all things ye are made rich in him, in all kind of speech. And in all knowledge.</hi> I thanke my God alwayes on your behalfe, not for your riches, for your honors, for your large posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, for your flourishing cittie, but for the grace of God, which is giuen you in <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for your free vocation, for your faith, for your reconciliation, for your iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for your regeneration, for your hope of eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the preaching of the word of God among you, and for your knowledge of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of this truth of God, farre surpasseth all the treasures of this corruptible world. Shall not we then poure out our soules in thankfulnes before almightie God, for bestowing vpon vs so gracious a blessing, as is <hi>this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth of God?</hi> Let vs with the spirit of blessed <hi>Paul,</hi> account all things which haue beene, or are gainefull
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1741:8"/> to vs in this present world, to be but losse and dung in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>this knowledge of Gods holy truth,</hi> forasmuch as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may winne <hi>Christ.</hi> Thus haue you the second vse of my doctrine. My doctrine was:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God is truth in himselfe, in his workes, and in his words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second vse concerneth our thankesgiuing for <hi>the knowledge of Gods truth.</hi> The third tendeth to our imitation.</p>
               <p>Is it true? Is God <hi>truth in himselfe, in his workes, and in his words?</hi> Why striue we not with all the faculties, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our soules to represent our God in <hi>truth?</hi> He in the beginning, in the first man, in our forefather <hi>Adam,</hi> created and made vs in his owne image, after his owne likenesse. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. Then was man inuested with glorious roabes, with immortalitie, with vnderstanding, with freedome of will: then was he perfectly good, and chast, and pure, and iust, and true: Whatsoeuer might appertaine to happines, or holinesse, he then had it. For God created him so like vnto himselfe in perfect happines, and holinesse; that he might in some sort beare about with him the image of the great and glorious <hi>God</hi> of Heauen.</p>
               <p>But alas, our first Parent continued not long in that his first estate, of puritie, innocencie, and integritie; by his fall he lost vs, that his precious Iewell, which, (had he stood fast) would haue beene vnto vs a chaine of gold about our neckes; yea, as it is called <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.5. <hi>A crowne of honor, and glorie.</hi> But by his fall we are become miserable, and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wicked, and vncleane, and false; as vnlike to God, as <hi>darkenesse</hi> is to <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> is to <hi>Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this estate of sinne, and death, we all lay wallowing, till God of his owne vnspeakeable mercy, and goodnesse raised vs vp by his grace to a better state; a state of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and saluation; wherein all we whose names are written in the Register of the elect, and chosen children of <hi>God,</hi> must spend the remainder and residue of the dayes of our pilgrimage in this world. In this state wee must not stand at one stay, but must alwayes be growing vpward. We must day by day endeuour to encrease our spirituall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1741:8"/> strength, and change our Christian infancie with a ripe and constant age; and adde grace to grace, till we become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect men in <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To vs, now in the state of regeneration belongeth the exhortation of God vnto the children of <hi>Israell.</hi> Leuit. 11.44. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy:</hi> And that of <hi>Christ</hi> to his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors vpon the Mount. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heauen is perfect:</hi> or as it is in S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> Chap. 6.36. <hi>Be ye mercifull, as your Father also is merciful.</hi> By which places we are not exhorted to a perfection of supererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Monkes</hi> would haue it, nor to a perfect and absolute fulfilling of the Law; for that is impossible, so long as wee carry about vs these vessels of corruption: witnesse S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 8.3. But all that we are exhorted to, is, that we would do our best endeuours to resemble our God, and to be like vnto him, in holinesse, in perfection, in mercifulnesse. <hi>Be holy, as God is holy: be perfect, as God is perfect; be mercifull, as God is mercifull; non absoluta aequalitate, sed similitudine:</hi> not absolutely, and equally, <hi>holy, perfect,</hi> and <hi>mercifull,</hi> as God is, but by a similitude. God is our <hi>Father:</hi> and will not we his children, like good children, striue to be acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated and fitted to our <hi>Fathers</hi> vertues?</p>
               <p>Beloued, let vs apply our selues to this imitation of our heauenly <hi>Father,</hi> to be <hi>holy,</hi> as <hi>he is holy;</hi> to be <hi>perfect,</hi> as <hi>he is perfect;</hi> to be <hi>mercifull,</hi> as <hi>he is mercifull;</hi> and for my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose, <hi>to be true,</hi> as <hi>he is true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this last we may thus be led. God is our Creator; and he is the <hi>God of truth.</hi> Psal. 31.5. Christ is our Redeemer, and <hi>he is Truth. Ioh.</hi> 14.6. We are renued by the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> and he is the <hi>spirit of Truth. Ioh.</hi> 16.13. We liue in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of the Church; and she is the <hi>pillar and ground of Truth</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Thus liuing, we are <hi>taught by the word of truth. Colos.</hi> 1.5. And are brought to <hi>the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. And are <hi>sanctified by Truth. Ioh.</hi> 17.17. Adde hereto, that we are commaunded euery one to <hi>speake the Truth, Ephes.</hi> 4.25. And shall we doe our best to resemble God <hi>in Truth?</hi> To be <hi>true</hi> as he is <hi>true?</hi> Dearely beloued,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1741:9"/> sith we are the children of <hi>Truth</hi> (for <hi>God is Truth,</hi> and his children we are) let vs walke, as it becometh the <hi>children of Truth:</hi> let <hi>Truth</hi> be in our thoughts, in our words, in our workes: in all our wayes.</p>
               <p>What shall I more say to this poynt, but exhort you in S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Paules</hi> words, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.25. That ye would cast off lying, and speake euery man the <hi>truth</hi> to his neighbour. For as much as the <hi>Lord will destroy all such as speake lies.</hi> This you know by the fift <hi>Psalme,</hi> ver. the 6. But how will he destroy them? It is answered, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.8. <hi>All lyars shall haue their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimstone.</hi> Thus haue you the third vse of my doctrine. My doctrine was:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God is truth in himselfe, in his workes, and in his words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third vse is, our holy imitation of God in <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet a fourth vse of this doctrine of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> It serues for a redargution, or reproofe of such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>truth.</hi> Deny <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>truth?</hi> Can there be any, endued with a reasonable soule, so voyd of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing? Yes. There is a generation of men monstrously mishapen in the powers of the soule, who spare not to break the cords of Religion asunder, and to cast her yoke from them. They dare auouch with those in <hi>Tullie, Totam de Dijs immortalibus opinionem fictam esse ab hominibus sapienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus reipub. causâ, vt quos ratio non posset, eos ad officium religio duceret:</hi> judging the seruice of God to be a meere deuise of man, for the better gouernment of the Common-wealth; wherein inferiors, sith they will not be ruled by <hi>reason,</hi> must be ordered by <hi>religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tell such of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> you may as well vrge them with <hi>Lucians</hi> narrations: tell them of <hi>repentance,</hi> they cast it behind them: tell them of <hi>faith,</hi> they regard it not. Speake to them of <hi>baptisme,</hi> they hold it of no greater price, then the washing of their hands. Let them heare of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> this feeds them with many a merry conceit. They thinke pleasantly with themselues, what manner of bodies they shall haue at that day, of what proportion and stature their bodies shall be; whether their nayles, and haire shall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1741:9"/> rise againe. Impious wretches, thus they make a scoffe at <hi>God</hi> and <hi>religion:</hi> whom, were they vsed according to their deserts, the Preachers should pronounce, and the Prince proclaime the foulest leapers, that euer yet sore ranne vpon; very worthy to bee excluded the hoast, and to haue their habitation alone: yea to be exiled the land, and to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from nature it selfe, which so vnnaturally they striue to bring to naught. I say no more against them; but leaue them to the <hi>God of truth,</hi> whom they haue denied, that he in due time may repay them home with vengeance.</p>
               <p>Thus farre am I guided by my first doctrine, grounded vpon this essentiall name of <hi>God,</hi> his name <hi>Iehouah:</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting his <hi>truth</hi> in himselfe, in his workes, and in his words: <hi>Thus saith Iehouah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus saith the Lord]</hi> Is not this the prophesie of <hi>Amos?</hi> Are not all the words of this prophesie, chap. 1.1. called <hi>the words of Amos the heardsman?</hi> What then meaneth this phrase, <hi>Thus saith the Lord?</hi> As Almighty God in olde time spake to our Fathers by <hi>the mouth of Moses,</hi> Exod 4.12. So did hee in succeeding ages speake vnto them by <hi>the mouth of other his Prophets, Luke</hi> 1.70. Heereto <hi>S. Peter</hi> beareth record, 2. <hi>Epist.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Know this,</hi> saith he, <hi>that no prophesie in the Scripture is of any priuate motion;</hi> and he giues the reason heereof, <hi>verse</hi> 21. For, <hi>the prophesie in old time, came not by the will of man, but holy men of God spake, as they were mooued by the holy Ghost.</hi> Hence sprang those vsuall and familiar speeches in the bookes of the Prophets: <hi>The word of the Lord came vnto me; The Lord God hath spoken,</hi> and this in my Text: <hi>Thus sayth the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Lord,</hi> who thus spake in old time by his Prophets, did in fulnesse of time, when he sent to consummate, and perfect the worke of mans redemption, speake by his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Euangelists and Apostles. This appeareth by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promise made vnto them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Take no thought how, or what yee shall speake: It is not yee that speake, but the Spirit of your Father, that speaketh in you.</hi> It must stand euer true, what is recorded 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The whole
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1741:10"/> Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God.</hi> The whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and euery parcell of it, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h inward witnesse from the Spirit, which is the author of all truth. Sweet then is the harmony, consent and agreement of all the Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists, and Apostles, from the first vnto the last. Not one of them spake one word of a naturall man, in all their ministeries: the words which they spake, were the words of him that sent them: they spake not of themselues; God spake in them. Whensoeuer were the time, whatsoeuer were the meanes, whosoeuer were the man, wheresoeuer were the place, whatsoeuer were the people, the words were the Lords. Hence ariseth this doctrine:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Author of holy Scripture is neither man nor Angell, nor any other creature, how excellent soeuer, but onely the liuing and immortall God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth is euident, by this which I haue but now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For if <hi>God</hi> in old time spake to our <hi>Fathers,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Moses,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> spake by other his Prophets, if <hi>God</hi> spake by the Euangelists and Apostles, if all Scripture be inspired of God; then it well followeth; that <hi>God is the author of Scripture:</hi> and therefore not <hi>man,</hi> nor <hi>Angell, nor any other creature, how excellent soeuer.</hi> I can but point at the vses of this doctrine.</p>
               <p>The first vse is redargution. Is the <hi>liuing and immortall God the author of holy Scripture?</hi> Heere are all they to bee reprooued, who doe vilifie and debase the <hi>sacred Scriptures,</hi> and esteeme not of them, as of <hi>the word of God.</hi> Such are they, who bearing in their fore-heads, the stampe of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> haue notwithstanding giuen their names to that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>now-false Church</hi> there.

               <p>Is the <hi>liuing and immortall God the author of holy Scripture?</hi> Heere then is a lesson for vs, whom God hat set a part to be <hi>Preachers,</hi> and Expounders of his will. We must handle his <hi>sacred Scripture,</hi> as his <hi>holy word:</hi> wee must euer come vnto you, as my Prophet heere did to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> with <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> in our mouthes. Wee may not speake either the imagination of our owne braines, or the vaine perswasions of our own hearts. We must sincerely preach vnto you, Gods gracious word without all corruption, or deprauing of the same. To this S <hi>Peter</hi> well exhorteth vs in his 1. Epist. and chap. 4.11. <hi>If any man speake, let him speake as the word of God.</hi> For if <hi>wee,</hi> yea if <hi>an Angell from Heauen</hi> shall preach otherwise vnto you, then from the Lords own mouth, speaking in his holy word, <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1741:11"/>
               <p>The third vse of this doctrine, is peculiar vnto you (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued) who are auditors and hearers of the word. Is <hi>the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and immortall God the author of holy Scripture?</hi> Then (Beloued) it is your part to heare vs with attention, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, whensoeuer wee stand before you, to expound Gods holy Scripture. <hi>S. Paul</hi> commendeth the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> Epist. 1. chap. 2.13. For that whensoeuer <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the Apostles of Christ, the word of the preaching of God, they receiued it not as the word of men, but as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, the word of God.</hi> In like sort, if you receiue it, it will <hi>saue your soules.</hi> It is <hi>able so to doe.</hi> S. <hi>Iames</hi> shall bee your pledge, chap. 1.21. Receiue it therefore with meeknesse, that by it your soules may liue.</p>
               <p>God spake vnto <hi>Israel</hi> in a vision by night, and sayd <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.2. <hi>Iaacob, Iaacob. Iaacob</hi> answered, I am heere. He was prest and ready with all reuerent attention, to heare what his God would say vnto him, and to follow the same with all faithfull obedience. Such readinesse well becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euery childe of God at this day in the Church, where God speaketh. Thus must hee thinke within himselfe. It is thine ordinance, ô <hi>Lord,</hi> by thy word preached to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct me, concerning thy holy will. I am heere, <hi>Lord,</hi> in all humble feare, to heare thy blessed pleasure, what this day thou wilt put into the mouth of the Preacher to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto me, I am heere, speake on, <hi>Lord,</hi> thy seruant hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. If a Prince of this world, or some great man shall speake vnto you, you will attend, and giue eare vnto him with all diligence; how much more then ought yee so to doe, when the King of Heauen, and Lord of the Earth, the liuing and immortall God, calleth vpon you by his Ministers?</p>
               <p>What remaineth but that you suffer a word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It shall bee short: in <hi>S. Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3.16. Holy and beloued, as the elect of God, <hi>let the word of God dwell plenteously in you in all wisdome.</hi> This word of God, it is his most royall and celestiall Testament, it is the oracle of his heauenly Sanctuarie, it is the only key vnto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1741:11"/> vs of his reuealed counsels; it is milke from his sacred breasts, the earnest and pledge of his fauor to his Church, the light of our feete, the ioy of our hearts, the breath of our nostrils, the pillar of our faith, the anchor of our hope, the ground of our loue, the euidence of our future blessednes.</p>
               <p>Let this word of God dwell plenteously in you in all wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. So shall your wayes by it be clensed, and your selues made cleane. Yet a very litle while, &amp; he that shall come, will come, &amp; will not tarry, euen our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> who finding your wayes clensed, and your selues made cleane by his sacred word, will in his due time translate you from this valley of teares, into <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which is aboue, the most glorious Citie of God. There shall this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible put on incorruption, and our morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie shall be swallowed vp of life. Euen so be it.</p>

                  <hi>Moab</hi> was one of the sonnes of <hi>Lot,</hi> begotten in incest vpon his eldest daughter. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.37. From him by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall descent came these <hi>Moabites,</hi> a people inhabiting that part of the East, which is commonly knowne by the name of <hi>Coelesyria,</hi> but was formerly the possession of the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</hi> These <hi>Moabites,</hi> like their brethren the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> were professed enemies to the people of God, and did euermore very grieuously afflict, and vex them. In which respect, they were for euer by God his singular command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment excluded from the Church. Gods commandement
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1741:12"/> is expressed <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.3. <hi>The Ammonites, and the Moabites shall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord.</hi> And its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.1. <hi>The Ammonites, and the Moabites shall not enter into the Congregation of God.</hi> Thus haue you the accused; euen the <hi>Moabites;</hi> the posteritie of <hi>Moab,</hi> who was <hi>Lots</hi> sonne; inhabitants of <hi>Coelesyria,</hi> and borderers vpon the Holy Land, the possession of the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what are they accused of? Of many breaches of Gods law: in these words, <hi>For three, and foure transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions]</hi> This phrase we met with fiue times in the former chapter, and haue heard it diuersly expounded. The most naturall, proper and significant exposition commended to you was; by three, and foure, a finite, and certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to vnderstand many; a number infinite, &amp; vncertaine. <hi>For three transgressions of Moab, and for foure,</hi> that is, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny transgressions of the <hi>Moabites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the many transgressions of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> their inhumanitie, and pride are specially noted. Their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, spightfull, and cruell dealing against the <hi>Israelites,</hi> though a people of their owne kinred, appeareth diuers wayes. First, because when the <hi>Israelites</hi> came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they met them not with prouision. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.4. Secondly, because at that time they hired<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Balaam,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Beor,</hi> to curse them. <hi>Num.</hi> 22.5. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they kept them in seruitude vnder King <hi>Eglon</hi> eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres. <hi>Iudic.</hi> 3.12. Fourthly, because without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their allegiance to the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> due vnto them vpon King <hi>Dauids</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.2.</note> conquest, they rebelled against <hi>Israel</hi> after the death of <hi>Ahab.</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 1.1. Fiftly, because they waged warre against <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> King of <hi>Iudah.</hi> 2 <hi>Chrō.</hi> 20.1. Sixtly, because they derided the <hi>Israelites,</hi> vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, and made a iest at them. <hi>Ier.</hi> 48.27. <hi>Zephan.</hi> 2.8. You see the inhumanitie of the <hi>Moabites.</hi> Concerning their pride, heare the words of <hi>Ieremie</hi> chap. 48.29. <hi>We haue heard the pride of</hi> Moab: <hi>(he is exceeding proud)</hi> we haue heard <hi>his pride, his stoutnesse, his arrogancie, his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and the hautinesse of his heart.</hi> Of this pride of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1741:13"/>
                  <hi>Moab</hi> you may see more <hi>Esai.</hi> 16.6.</p>
               <p>Of the many sinnes of <hi>Moab,</hi> you see two specially no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: their <hi>inhumanitie,</hi> and their <hi>pride:</hi> for which, and others, the <hi>Lord</hi> protesteth against them, that he will not turne to them. <hi>I will not turne to it]</hi> That is, as heretofore hath bin expounded, I will not be fauourable to the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites;</hi> I will not spare them; according to their deserts, so shall it be vnto them: I will not recall them to the right way; they shall runne on to their owne perdition: I will not turne away the punishment, wherewith I haue resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to punish them: I am the <hi>Lord,</hi> I am not changed. <hi>I will not turne to it]</hi> It is in effect, as if the <hi>Lord</hi> had thus said: If the <hi>Moabites</hi> had offended but once, or twise, I would haue bin fauourable to them, and would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cald them into the right way, that so they might haue bin converted, and haue escaped my punishments: But now, sith they daily heape transgression vpon transgression, and make no end of sinning, I haue hardned my face against them, and will not suffer them to be converted; but indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and obstinate as they are, I will vtterly destroy them. <hi>For three transgressions of Moab, and for foure I will not turne to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here may you recall to your remembrances a doctrine sundry times recommended to your religious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many sinnes doe plucke downe from Heauen the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wrath and vengeance of God vpon the sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is of pure eyes and beholdeth not iniquitie. He hath laid righteousnes to the rule, and weighed his iustice in a ballance. His sentence is passed forth from him, and stands vnalterable: <hi>Tribulation and anguish vpon euery soule that doth euill.</hi> The soule that sinneth, it shall be punished. God makes it good by an oath <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.41. <hi>That he will whet his glittring sword, and his hand shall take hold on iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to execute vengeance for sinne.</hi> His soule hateth, and abhorreth sinne; his law curseth, and condemneth sinne; his hand smiteth, and scourgeth sinne. Sinne was his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1741:13"/> to cast downe Angels into Hell, to thrust <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise, to turne Cities into ashes, to ruinate Nations, to torment his owne bowels in the similitude of sinfull flesh. Because of sinne he once drowned the old world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sinne ere long will burne this. Thus doe many sinnes plucke downe &amp;c.</p>
               <p>One vse of this doctrine, is; to teach vs heedfulnesse in all our wayes, that we doe not by our many sinnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke Almighty God to high displeasure.</p>
               <p>A second Vse, is; to moue vs to a serious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wonderfull patience of Almighty God, who did so graciously forbeare these <hi>Moabites,</hi> till by their three, and foure transgressions, by their many sinnes they had prouoked him to indignation. These things I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore laboured to lay vnto your hearts.</p>
               <p>Now therefore I proceed to the third part of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie: wherein you haue the declaration of that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinne, by which the <hi>Moabites</hi> so highly offended. This their sinne was a sinne of <hi>cruelty;</hi> expressed in these words: <hi>Because it burnt the bones of the King of Ed m into lime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this was done, or by which of the Kings of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> or against which of the Kings of <hi>Edom,</hi> it is not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in holy Scripture. Some would hither referre that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. Where it is recorded of the King of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> that he assisted with two other Kings, the King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the King of <hi>Edom,</hi> made war vpon the King of <hi>Moab.</hi> The King of <hi>Moab,</hi> when he saw the battle was to sore for him, tooke with him seauen hundred stout warriours, and would haue broken throw to the King of <hi>Edom,</hi> but could not. Through indignation whereof<note n="c" place="margin">Piscat. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys in <hi>2</hi> Reg. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> some thinke that hee tooke the King of <hi>Edoms</hi> eldest sonne, and offered him for a burnt offering vpon the wall: for so some will haue the last verse of that chapter vnderstood of the King of <hi>Edoms</hi> sonne. But I take it more agreeable to that storie, there to vnderstand the King of <hi>Moabs</hi> owne sonne: that the King of <hi>Moab</hi> should offer vp for a burnt offering vpon the wall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1741:14"/> his owne eldest sonne, thereby to obtaine helpe of his God against his enemies. And so that storie appertaines not to this my Text. No; though wee receiue the former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. For it is not here said, that he burnt the bones of the <hi>King of Edoms sonne</hi> into lime, but the bones of the <hi>King of Edom</hi> himselfe.</p>
               <p>It is a tradition of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that after the buriall of the <hi>King of Edom</hi> (that King, who went vp with<note n="d" place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 3.1.</note>

Of this tradition <hi>S. Ierome</hi> maketh mention: <hi>They did digge vp the King of Edoms bones, and burne them.</hi> Great was their rage, great their cruelty. Death appeased them not. <hi>The King of Edoms bones</hi> were not suffered to rest in his sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, but were taken thence, and burnt into ashes. These ashes some thinke were vsed with lime, or morter for the plaistering, pargetting, or rough-casting of their houses: for as much as my Prophet here saith, they <hi>burnt the bones of the King of Edom into lime.</hi> If so; it was done <hi>Vindictae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioris, &amp; contumeliae causâ;</hi> that they might take full venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vpon the King of <hi>Edom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may not passe it ouer with silence, that this cruelty of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> was against the <hi>Edomites,</hi> without all respect of bloud, and consanguinity. <hi>Edom,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> or <hi>Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeans</hi> were descended from <hi>Abraham.</hi> Thus:<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>Moab,</hi> from whom the nation of the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> tooke their name, was sonne vnto <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> brothers sonne, the sonne of<note n="k" place="margin">

               <p>Now we see what is the particular sinne of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> for which this prophecy is directed against them. Their sinne is <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and a speciall kinde of <hi>Cruelty;</hi> euen their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1741:14"/> denying of rest to the bones of the dead: and the more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and intolerable is their <hi>Cruelty,</hi> because it is against their owne kindred.</p>
               <p>The lesson, which we are to take from hence, is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All kinde of cruelty committed against a man, highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God; but that specially, which violateth, and extinguisheth the rites of consanguinity, and naturall affection.</hi>

Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture I recommended it vnto you; varying my propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus: <hi>Cruelty is a sinne hatefull vnto God.</hi> Now it comes vnto you in another forme, though the matter be the same▪ <hi>All kinde of cruelty, &amp;c.</hi> My proposition hath two parts.</p>
               <p>The first, <hi>All kind of cruelty committed against a man, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly displeaseth God.</hi> The second; <hi>There is a kinde of cruelty, that violateth, and extinguisheth the rightes of consanguinity, and naturall affection, and that specially displeaseth God.</hi> First, to the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All kinde of cruelty committed against a man highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No maruaile. For all kinde of <hi>cruelty</hi> is sin; and euery sin must taste of Gods high displeasure. All kinde of <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> is sin: For it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a want of conformity to the Law of God, a transgression of the law, a breach of the law. Will you know against which commandement it is? It is against the sixt commandement. The commandement is: <hi>Thou shalt doe no murther;</hi> or, <hi>Thou shalt not kill.</hi> Where to <hi>kill,</hi> or to <hi>doe murther;</hi> by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> signifieth any kinde of endamaging the person of our neighbours. We may not so much as hurt, or hinder them. We are forbidden to sin against our neighbour, either in heart, or in word, or in countenance, or in deed. And in this last branch is <hi>cruelty</hi> forbidden vs. So is the first part of my proposition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; <hi>All kinde of crueltie committed against a man highly displeaseth God.</hi> The reason is; because it is a sin, against the sixth commandement.</p>

Among many, and they great causes, he giues this for one <hi>Vt innotesceret nostra immanitas, &amp; saeuitia, qui etiam in mortuum saeuimus;</hi> that notice may be taken of our immanitie, &amp; crueltie, for as much as we spare not the dead. It is the propertie of a Lyon, to spare a man, not onely, that is dead, but also that lyeth prostrate, and flat vpon the ground: What fauour a man receiues from a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the sweete <hi>Sauiour</hi> of mankind, could not receiue from man.

               <p>In the 79. <hi>Psalme</hi> ver. 2. the Prophet in <hi>Israels</hi> behalfe complaineth vnto God, against the surprisers of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that <hi>they gaue the dead bodies of Gods seruants to be meat vnto the fowles of heauen, and the flesh of his Saints to the beasts of the Earth.</hi> So he aggrauateth their crueltie, and inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Monstrous was their crueltie, barbarous their inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to cast the dead bodies, and flesh of Gods seruants, and Saints here, and there, to the end they might be a prey

The bodies of the dead belong to Gods prouidence. He hath appointed the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the dead, to confirme our faith in the Resurrection of the dead.</p>
               <p>Thus farre by occasion of the first part of my propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which was, <hi>All kind of crueltie, committed against a man, highly displeaseth God.</hi> You remember the reason of it: the reason is; <hi>Because it is against the sixt Commandement.</hi> The vse of it, was a reproofe of such as delight in <hi>crueltie,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the liuing, or the dead. Now followeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of my proposition: this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That crueltie which violateth, or extinguisheth the rites of consanguinitie, and naturall affection, specially displeaseth God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1741:17"/>
               <p>For God, the God of nature, cannot in any wise like, that natures lawes be violated. By natures lawes, its enacted, that there should be, that same <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, much spoken of in the Schooles; a peculiar affection of loue from the parent to the childe, and from the childe to the parent; from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a brother, from a kinsman to a kinsman. Now if <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie</hi> shall be exercised from a parent towards his childe, or from a child towards his parent, or from a brother towards his brother, or from a kinsman towards his kinsman, that same <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I spak of, is laid aside; the rites of consanguinity, and naturall affection are violated, are extinguished.</p>
               <p>This doctrine may teach vs, to carry our selues peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and louingly towards our parents, our children, our brethren, our kinsmen, all that are of our bloud. There cannot be a greater bond betweene man and man, <hi>as men;</hi> then is this bond of bloud. I say precisely betweene man and man, <hi>as men,</hi> there cannot be a greater bond, then is this bond of bloud. For betweene man and man, <hi>as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> there is a greater bond; the bond of <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptisme, one God,</hi> and <hi>Father of all,</hi> which is <hi>aboue all,</hi> and <hi>through all,</hi> and <hi>in you all,</hi> as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi> 4.5.6.</p>
               <p>The strength of the former bond of bloud, sheweth it selfe in the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> when there was a debate betweene his seruants, and the seruants of <hi>Lot.</hi> All the tales his men could tell him, could not worke in him any dislike of <hi>Lot.</hi> To end that debate, <hi>Abraham</hi> goeth to <hi>Lot. Abraham, Lots</hi> elder, and vnckle, his better in euery respect, yet he stands not vpon that; he looks not when <hi>Lot</hi> should come, and stoope to him; but as in yeeres, so in wisdome, in mildnesse, in humility, in temperance of affections hee passeth him. Ouer-ruled by such sweet vertues, hee goes to <hi>Lot,</hi> tels him of their kinred, and mooues him thereby, as by a strong reason, or a mighty bond, that loue and peace might remaine betwixt them and theirs. His words, are as the words whereof <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh, <hi>Prou.</hi> 25.11. they are <hi>like apples of gold with pictures of siluer,</hi> they are spoken in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1741:17"/> their place; and are recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.8. where <hi>Abraham</hi> thus speaketh vnto <hi>Lot: Let there bee no strife, I pray thee, betweene thee and me, neither betweene thy heard-men and my heard-men; for we be brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We be brethren:]</hi> He might haue sayd wee bee <hi>cosens,</hi> or thou art my <hi>nephew,</hi> my <hi>brothers sonne,</hi> but hee vseth rather apellation of equality, and cals him <hi>brother,</hi> to manifest his desire of peace and concord.</p>
               <p>You see the strength of the bond of bloud, how forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is betweene man and man, <hi>as men.</hi> I told you of a stronger bond betweene man and man, <hi>as Christians,</hi> and that was the bond of <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, one God</hi> and <hi>Father of all,</hi> which is <hi>aboue all,</hi> and <hi>through all,</hi> and <hi>in vs all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So there is a two-fold kinred, or brotherhood. The one, by <hi>nature,</hi> the other by <hi>grace:</hi> the one, by <hi>generation,</hi> the other, by <hi>regeneration.</hi> In respect of both, we are tyed with bonds of loue. First, in respect of the former. After <hi>Noahs</hi> floud, there was a diuision of countreyes made to the remainder of <hi>Adams</hi> posterity: some dwelt heere, some there; some in one place, some in another, as they best liked; yet one bloud remained amongst them, as a knot euer to ioyne them in amity and loue, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place soeuer seuered them. Is it not so still, though longer time, and larger encrease haue spred it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Yes (Beloued) it is so. And therefore this bond of bloud, stocke, house, linage, and kinred in the root, should continue among vs, regard one of another, and make vs loue one another, more then we doe.</p>
               <p>But this kinred, by <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>generation,</hi> so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees remooued from the root, our great grand-father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the first of men, little mooueth vs; wee disdaine to take notice of it. Let then the other kinred, that of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>regeneration,</hi> by its stronger bonds of loue, tye &amp; ioyne vs together.

               <p>Dearely Beloued, sith wee are become the sonnes of God vpon a condition, let vs fulfill the condition; let vs bee brethren, one to another. That is, let vs not bee cruell, one towards another; let vs doe no iniury, one to another, let vs be mercifull one to another, let vs loue one another. Let good <hi>Abraham</hi> be the patterne of our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If there be any variance, or iarring among vs, let vs goe one to another, and kindely entreat one another; <hi>I pray thee, let there bee no variance, no iarring, betweene mee and thee, nor betweene my men and thy men, for we are brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But proud and rebellious flesh and bloud will not suffer vs to become <hi>Abrahams;</hi> so wise, so meeke, such louers of concord and vnity. Not suffer vs? Then is our condition fearefull, and we may well expect, that the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> at his great day of visitation, shall reiect vs, and cast vs from out his sight into the euer burning lake. There is no entrance into the Heauenly Canaan, for the cruell, injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, malicious and despitefull man.</p>
               <p>Its onely <hi>Loue</hi> that opens the gates of Heauen; without <hi>Loue</hi> whatsoeuer you doe, its no aduantage to you. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. that <hi>though you speake with the tongues of men and Angels, and haue not Loue, you are but as sounding brasse, or a tinckling cymball: and though you haue the gift of prophesie, and know all secrets, yea, if you haue all faith, so that yee can remooue mountaines, and haue not Loue, you are nothing: and though you feede the poore with all your goods, and giue your bodies to bee burnt, and haue not Loue, it profiteth you nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To bee short, almes without <hi>Loue,</hi> prophesie without <hi>Loue,</hi> knowledge without <hi>Loue,</hi> miracles without <hi>Loue,</hi> martyrdome without <hi>Loue,</hi> prayer without <hi>Loue,</hi> and the

I conclude with S. <hi>Iohns</hi> words in his 1 Epist. cap. 4. vers. 7. <hi>Beloued, let vs loue one another, for Loue commeth of God, and euery one that loueth, is borne of God, and knoweth God. For God is Loue; if therefore wee dwell in Loue, we dwell in God, and God dwells in vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, O Lambe of God, that takest away the sinnes of the world, take from vs all bitternesse, and anger, and wrath, and crying, and euill speaking, with all malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

               <p>Of <hi>Moab</hi> you heard somewhat in my last Sermon; that <hi>Moab</hi> was <hi>Lots</hi> sonne, and that from him lineally descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Moabites,</hi> a people inhabiting that part of the East, which is commonly knowne by the name of <hi>Caelesyria,</hi> and was in former times the possession of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> I now adde, that from the same <hi>Moab,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Lot,</hi> a city in <hi>Arabia,</hi> afterward called <hi>Areopolis,</hi> was named <hi>Moab,</hi> and thence the whole prouince, region, countrey, or kingdome was likewise named <hi>Moab.</hi> So saith<note n="b" place="margin">De locis.</note>
                  <hi>Eusebius.

               <p>The first circumstance concerneth the punisher: the <hi>Lord:</hi> for thus saith the <hi>Lord, I will send</hi> a fire.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">See my Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures vpon the first of <hi>Amos.</hi>

                  <hi>It is proper to the</hi> Lord <hi>to execute vengeance vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for their sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth hath sundry times been recommended vnto you. Diuerse were the vses of it.</p>
               <p>The first was, to lesson vs to looke heedefully vnto our feet; that wee walke not in the way of sinners, to partake with them in their sinnes. <hi>Sinnes</hi> are not tongue-tyed; they cry aloud vnto the <hi>Lord</hi> for <hi>vengeance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second was, to admonish vs, not to intermeddle in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1741:20"/> the Lords office; Its his office to execute <hi>vengeance.</hi> Wee therefore may not interpose our selues.</p>
               <p>The third was, to minister a word of comfort to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, against whom the wicked, do behaue themselues proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and despiteously. God in due time, for such their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior will render <hi>vengeance</hi> vnto them, and will punish them with euerlasting perdition.</p>
               <p>The second circumstance concerneth the punishment, which is by fire: <hi>I will send a fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By fire heere wee are to vnderstand, not so much a true and naturall fire, as a figuratiue and metaphoricall fire. The sword, pestilence, and famine, <hi>quod libet genus consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> euery kinde of consumption, <hi>quaelibet species exci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Fire</hi> in this place is put for the sword, for warre, as its plain by the sequell of this text. The Doctrine arising hence is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fire</hi> (whether naturall or figuratiue) that is, <hi>the fire and all other creatures are at the Lords commandement, to bee employed by him in the punishment of the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this doctrine heeretofore.</p>
               <p>The vse of it is, to teach vs how to carry our selues at such times, as God shall visit vs with his rod of correction; how to behaue our selues in all our afflictions. Wee are not so much to looke to the meanes, as to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that worketh by them. If the fire, or water, or any other of Gods creatures, shall at any time rage, and preuaile against vs, we must know, that God by them worketh hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> holy will vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Heere wee see; God resolueth <hi>to send a fire vpon Moab,</hi> which should <hi>deuoure the palaces of Kerioth:</hi> which was the third circumstance.</p>
               <p>Must <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Kerioth,</hi> two chiefe cities of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Moab,</hi> through the fire of Gods wrath be brought to ruine? It yeelds this doctrine:</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1741:20"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>No munition, no fortification, no strength can saue that city, which God will haue destroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One vse of this Doctrine is to lesson vs; that we put not any confidence in any worldly helpe; but that so we vse all good meanes of our defense, that still wee rely vpon the <hi>Lord,</hi> for strength and successe thereby.</p>
               <p>A second Vse is, to put vs in minde of the fearefull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, which God layeth vpon men for sinne. He deuoureth their cities, throweth downe their strong holds, and spares them not.</p>
               <p>A third Vse is, to stirre vs vp to thankfulnes, for that it pleaseth God in mercy to spare, not onely our Cities, and strong holds, but also our country villages and poore cottages.</p>
               <p>It is not to be passed ouer without obseruation, that the palaces of <hi>Kerioth</hi> are here threatned, to be deuoured with this fire, sent from the <hi>Lord.</hi> Were I now to speake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Princes, or great Estates, I could from hence giue them an <hi>Item,</hi> that they set not their hearts ouermuch vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their castles, towers, mansion houses, faire palaces, or other goodly buildings, for as much as, if their sinnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it, the fire of Gods wrath will deuoure all those. But my auditorie is of another rancke. Yet may you take a lesson hence. Must the palaces of <hi>Carioth,</hi> for the sinnes of the inhabitants be deuoured with fire from the wrath of God? Your lesson is:</p>
               <p>God depriueth vs of a great blessing, when he taketh from vs our dwelling houses.</p>
               <p>The great commoditie or contentment, that commeth to euery one of vs by our dwelling houses, hath experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally made good vnto vs this truth. The Vses of it are diuers.</p>
               <p>One is, to teach vs to be humble before Almighty God, whensoeuer it shall please him to take from vs our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houses.</p>
               <p>A second is, to admonish vs, sith we peaceably enioy our dwelling houses, that we vse them to the furtherance of Gods glory.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1741:21"/>
               <p>A third is, to stirre vs vp to blesse and praise God day by day for the comfortable vse we haue of our dwelling houses.</p>
               <p>These things I haue heretofore laboured to lay vnto your hearts, occasioned by the like generall commination or denuntiation of iudgement (fiue times repeated) in the former chapter, against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> Now we are to consider what is more specially prophecied against these <hi>Moabites.</hi> For the easier explication whereof, I obserued two points:
<list>
                     <item>1. The manner of the punishment.</item>
                     <item>2. The extent of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Order requireth that first I speake to the manner of their punishment, expressed in these words: <hi>And Moab shall dye with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moab shall dye] Moab</hi> is here put for the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the people of <hi>Moab,</hi> the inhabitants of the Kingdome of <hi>Moab. Moab shall dye]</hi> There is a ciuill death, there is a corporall death, there is a spirituall death, and there is an eternall death. Which of these deaths were the <hi>Moabites</hi> to dye? The letter of my text is for the corporall death. This corporall death is a separation of the soule from the bodie: it is called corporall, in respect of the spirituall: it is also called a temporarie death, in respect of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. This death corporall, or temporarie, is twofold; either naturall, or accidentall; if accidentall, it is subdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into a violent, or a voluntarie death: and is common as well to the godly, as to the wicked; inflicted vpon them, by Gods iust iudgment for the sinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> This is the wages of sin, and this is the way of all sinfull flesh. <hi>All must once dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may a long time wrastle with the dangers of this world both by Land and Sea: thousands may fall on our right hand, and ten thousands on our left, while we stand:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1741:21"/> we may haue so good store of friends, that we may well say with the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I neede no speaking for me, either to the King, or to the Captaine of the Hoste; I dwell among mine owne people,</hi> where I can command: we may walke in the light of the sunne, that is, our prosperitie may be waxen so great, that we want nothing: we may haue sailes and oares at pleasure, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> seemed to haue, <hi>who thought in his pride to make men saile vpon the dry land, and to walke vpon the Sea:</hi> 2. <hi>Mac.</hi> 5.21. we may thinke our selues to be in league with death, and in couenant with the graue, and so promise to our selues, many a prosperous, and pleasant day, as many as are the sands of the Ocean: yet a time shall come, when all these things shall proue but vanitie: and <hi>Moab shall dye. All must once dye.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Moab shall dye] All must once dye. Death!</hi> It is of all miseries the last, and the most terrible. A holy<note n="k" place="margin">Apud Lud. Granatensem Exercit de Orat. &amp; Medit.</note> Father hath made against it this exclamation. <hi>O Death how bitter is the remembance of thee? How quickly and suddainely stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest thou vpon vs? How secret are thy paths and wayes? How
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1741:22"/> doubtfull is thy houre? How vniuersall is thy signiorie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion? The mighty cannot escape thee; the wise cannot hide themselues from thee; the strong loose their strength before thee; the rich with their money shall not corrupt thee. Thou art the hammer, that alwayes striketh: Thou art the sword, that neuer blunteth: thou art the snare, wherein all must be taken: thou art the prison, wherein all must lye: thou art the Sea, wherein all must perish: thou art the paine, that all must suffer: thou art the tribute, that all must pay.</hi> In a word; thou art such a one, as Almighty God washeth his hands of thee, and cleareth himselfe in plaine words, by the mouth of the Wiseman, saying, (<hi>Wisd.</hi> 1.13.) <hi>that he neuer made thee.</hi> Surely thou hast thine entry into the world by the very enuie, and craft of the Deuill.</p>
               <p>This exclamation against <hi>Death</hi> is very iust in some sense: for <hi>Death</hi> may be considered in a double respect; one way, as it is in its owne nature; another way, as it is changed, and qualified by the death of <hi>Christ. Death</hi> in its owne nature is a punishment of sin, a plague, a curse, or fore-runner of condemnation, the very gates, and suburbs of Hell it selfe: and in this respect the forecited excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hath due place. But on the other side, <hi>death</hi> being changed, and qualified by <hi>Christ</hi> his death, it is no more such; it is no more a punishment of sinne; it is no more a plague; it is no more a curse. For it is become a blessing; it brings an end to all our miseries; it giues full deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to all our miseries; it giues full deliuerance from all dangers; it is made vnto vs a passage, a way, an entrance into euerlasting life; it is like a portall, or litle gate, by which we passe from out this litle prison of our bodies into the kingdome of Heauen. The graue meane while is, but a resting chamber, sweetly perfumed by the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> for our bodies; from whence at the sound of the last trumpet, our bodies shall awake, and rise, and be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the paradise of heauen, to enioy the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable presence of Almighty God there.</p>
               <p>If <hi>death</hi> now changed and qualified by <hi>Christ</hi> his death,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1741:22"/> be a blessing: if it be but a passage from this wretched life to that happiest estate in heauen, why should death be feared?</p>
               <p>This is a Case of Conscience, and may be resolued. There are two sorts of men in the world: the one of them, who liue in their sinnes, and dye without repentance: the other of them, who with vnfeigned repentance and faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> doe leaue this world. The first haue great reason to feare <hi>Death: Death</hi> being vnto them the very gate, and introduction into the Hell of the damned: of whom we may well say, as <hi>Christ</hi> said of <hi>Iudas, Math.</hi> 26.24. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it had bin good for them, had they neuer bin borne. The second haue no reason to feare <hi>Death; Death</hi> being vnto them, as the gate of Heauen. To such, <hi>Optimum est nasci,</hi> its best that they are borne; and the next best for them is, <hi>maturè mori,</hi> to dye in a good houre. Their birth is to them a preparation to eternall happinesse, whereof their <hi>Death</hi> giues them full possession.</p>
               <p>The consideration whereof made King <hi>Salomon</hi> the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of Kings, or men, <hi>[praferre diem mortis, diei ortûs;]</hi> it made him preferre the day of death, before the day of birth; his words are <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Better is the day of death, then the day that one is borne.</hi> Hence is it, that most righteous <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 17.14. calls <hi>Corruption</hi> his <hi>father;</hi> for as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue fathers for their comfort, so had <hi>Iob</hi> death, and rottennesse: Corruption it selfe, as a father, made <hi>Iob</hi> fit for his graue and death; which of him was more wished then life: as <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Olympiodor</hi> haue well obserued. And hence it is that blessed <hi>Paul,</hi> liuing in this world, and vsing it, as if he vsed it not, (for he had his conuersation in heauen, and had a true, and liuely taste of the ioyes of the world to come) desired to be dissolued, and to be with <hi>Christ:</hi> and this (hee was well assured) was best of all for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p>Thus farre (beloued) haue I ledde you by occasion of these words, <hi>Moab shall dye:</hi> vpon which I grounded this generall doctrine.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1741:23"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>All must once dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the illustration whereof, I signified that of euils, <hi>death</hi> was the most terrible. To arme your Christian soules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the terrour or feare of <hi>death,</hi> I told you, that <hi>death</hi> is to be considered in a double respect; either as it is in its owne nature, or as it is changed, &amp; qualified by the death of Christ: in the first respect, it is very fearefull to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man: in the latter, it is very welcome to the resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Christian. I further added, that there are two sorts of men obnoxious vnto <hi>death:</hi> the one sort doe liue in sinne, and dye without repentance: the other with vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and true faith in <hi>Christ</hi> doe leaue this world; to the first sort <hi>death</hi> is very terrible: to the latter it is a very welcome guest. Now proceed we to examine the manner of <hi>Moabs</hi> death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moab shall dye with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.] In tumultu,</hi> with a tumult, so some do reade, <hi>Ʋatablus, Caluin, Mercer, Gualter; in strepitu,</hi> with a noyse, so <hi>Iunius,</hi> and <hi>Drusius; in sonitu,</hi> with a sound, so <hi>Brentius,</hi> and the author of the <hi>vulgar Latine.</hi> The 70. haue <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Moab</hi> shall dye <hi>through imbecillity,</hi> or <hi>weakenes.</hi> The word in the originall is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; it signifieth a <hi>sound,</hi> a <hi>tumult,</hi> an <hi>inundation,</hi> or <hi>multitude of waters,</hi> which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne their bankes with violence and roaring. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world is, that <hi>Moab</hi> should die a death strange and extraordinary: which is more specified in the next word.</p>

                  <hi>With shouting.]</hi> This very word we met with with in the 14. verse of the first Chapter, where it is brought to set forth the terrour of that iudgement, which God would bring vpon the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> The word I expounded in my 20. Sermon on the first Chapter, and shewed out of diuers Authorss that it signifieth a <hi>sound,</hi> a <hi>cry,</hi> a <hi>great cry,</hi> a <hi>voci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feration,</hi> a <hi>shoute,</hi> such as Souldiers doe make, when on a suddaine they surprize a City. To make good this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition it is added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With the sound of a trumpet.]</hi> The vse of trumpets in warre
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1741:23"/> hath beene very ancient. The vse of them is commanded to the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> Num. 10.9. <hi>When ye goe to warre against the enemie, yee shall blow a larme with the trumpets.</hi> After, they were vsed in the battle against <hi>Iericho,</hi> Iosh. 6.5. <hi>Ioshua</hi> saith to the people: <hi>When yee heare the sound of the trumpet, ye shall all shout with a great shout, and the wall of</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo <hi>shall fall downe flat.</hi> To this vse <hi>Ezechiel</hi> alludeth Chap. 7.14. <hi>They haue blowne the trumpet, and prepared all, but none goeth to the battell.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of it, 1. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 14.8. <hi>If the trumpet giue an vncertaine sound, who shall prepare himselfe to battle?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Zephanie</hi> also hath respect vnto it, Chap. 2.16. where he calls the great day of the <hi>Lord, a day of the trumpet, and a larme against the strong Cities, and against the high towers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this ancient vse of trumpets, we may gather the meaning of our Prophet in this place. <hi>Moab shall dye, with a tumult, with a shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet] Moab]</hi> that is, the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the people of <hi>Moab, shall dye]</hi> shall depart this life, and leaue this world, not quietly, and peaceably, in their beds, <hi>but with a tumult, with a shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet]</hi> euen in warre, or as the phrase is in the 14. verse of the 1. chapter, <hi>in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</hi> The doctrine arising hence is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warre, one of the executioners of Gods vengeance, is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more sent vpon a Land, for the sinnes of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>warre</hi> is one of the executioners of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, its plaine in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.21. There God himself makes it one of his foure sore iudgements. The foure are; the <hi>sword, famine,</hi> the <hi>noysome beast,</hi> and the <hi>pestilence;</hi> the first is the sword, an instrument for warre, for warre it selfe. These foure are likewise couched togither in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5.17. where thus saith the <hi>Lord</hi> against <hi>Ierusalem: I will send vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you famine, and euill beasts, and they shall spoyle thee, and pestilence and bloud shall through thee, and I will bring thee sword vpon thee; I the Lord haue spoken it.</hi> I will bring the <hi>sword</hi> vpon thee: the <hi>sword,</hi> that is, warre; an instrument of warre, for warre it selfe: as in the former place.</p>

               <p>These two places of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> (to omit many other, as pregnant, here and there dispersed throughout the sacred Volumes of Gods eternall word) these two doe speake plainely, that <hi>warre is one of the executioners of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</hi> That it is sent vpon a Land for the sinnes of the people, I made it plaine vnto you by like euidence of holy Writ in my 20. Sermon vpon the former chapter. My proofes were taken from <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.49. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.15. Whence I inferred, that <hi>warre,</hi> and all the euills of <hi>warre</hi> are from the <hi>Lord;</hi> that <hi>warre</hi> is one of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments of Gods iudgements; that <hi>warre</hi> is sent by God vpon a Land for the sinnes of a people. So goeth my doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warre, one of the executioners of Gods vengeance, is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more sent vpon a Land for the sinnes of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Vse of this Doctrine is, to raise vs vp to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the wonderfull patience of Almighty God. We grieue the Holy Spirit of that sacred Maiestie with our manifold and daily sinnes: our sinnes of omission, our sins of infirmitie, and our sinnes of presumption; our sinnes of ignorance, and our sinnes of wilfulnesse; our strife, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and debate; our vsurie, oppression, and cruelty; our vncleannesse, wantonnes, and drunkennes; our sins multiply as the sands of the Sea, they haue pressed into Gods presence to fetch downe his vengeance vpon vs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, looke about you, and admire his exceeding great patience. The loud crying of our sinnes hath not yet vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Lord</hi> so farre, as to make him come against vs with his sorest iudgement of <hi>warre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath out of his fatherly loue ouer vs mildely chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed vs. Not long since hee brake the staffe of our bread, and sent among vs a dearth and scarcitie; yet haue wee not returned vnto him. Not long since he commanded his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of waters to issue from out their channell, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer runne man and beast for many miles within this land; yet haue we not returned vnto him. Not long since he let flye his arrowes of pestilence, and yet they flye abroad to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1741:24"/> the killing of many round about vs; yet haue wee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto him.</p>
               <p>Not returned vnto him? What? Can no medicine, that God applyeth, mollifie our hard hearts? Can none of his corrections amend vs? Will we needs try whether he will send a sword vpon vs? He shaked his <hi>sword</hi> ouer vs, (many of vs may well remember it) when <hi>the great Spanish Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> floated on our Seas: but then as S. <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, chap. 2.13. <hi>Super exaltauit misericordia iudicio,</hi> mercy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted it selfe aboue iudgement, and we were spared.</p>
               <p>Were we spared? What shall we render to the <hi>Lord</hi> for so great mercy? We will with <hi>Dauid, Ps.</hi> 116.13. <hi>We will take the cup of saluation,</hi> we will <hi>call vpon the name of the Lord,</hi> and will <hi>offer vnto him the sacrifice of prayse.</hi> Which sacrifice of ours, that it may be acceptable to the <hi>Lord,</hi> let vs cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs all our transgressions, whereby we haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed; and with a new heart, and a new spirit, returne we to the <hi>Lord</hi> our God. But if we will persist with delight, and goe on in our old wayes; our crooked, peruerse, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wayes; our wayes of wickednesse; and will not bee turned out of them by any of <hi>God</hi> his milder chastisements and corrections, what can we expect, but the portion of these <hi>Moabites,</hi> euen <hi>fire</hi> &amp; a <hi>sword</hi> from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and with them to die <hi>with a tumult, with a shouting, and with the sound of a Trumpet?</hi>

                  <hi>I]</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Lord Iehovah,</hi> yesterday, and to day, and the same for euer; I am not changed; all my words, yea, all the titles of all my words are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen; Exscindam]</hi> I will cut off, I will root out, and destroy, <hi>Iudicem]</hi> the Iudge, the chiefest gouernour and ruler in <hi>Moab,</hi> the King. <hi>Nam Reges quo{que} populum indicabant,</hi> For <hi>Kings</hi> also did iudge the people, and it is euident by sundry places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1741:25"/> Scripture, that the state of the <hi>Moabites</hi> was swayed by Kings. <hi>I will cut off,</hi> root out, and vtterly destroy, <hi>the iudge,</hi> the King, <hi>out of the midst thereof]</hi> Out of the midst of what? Of <hi>Moab?</hi> of <hi>Kerioth?</hi> Both are mentioned vers. 2. <hi>Dauid, Camius,</hi> and some other, say of <hi>Kerioth,</hi> which was <hi>Sedes Regum,</hi> the cittie of the Kings habitation. The meaning is: there was no cittie in the Kingdome of <hi>Moab</hi> so strong, but that from out the midst of it, God would fetch the <hi>King,</hi> and cut him off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will cut off,</hi> roote out, or destroy, <hi>the iudge,</hi> the King, out of the middest of the strongest cittie of the Kingdome of <hi>Moab,</hi> be it <hi>Moab, Kerioth,</hi> or any other; <hi>I will slay all the Princes thereof with him;</hi> together with the King I will root out all the Princes of the land. None shall escape my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, neither Prince, nor King. You see the extent of this iudgement here denounced against <hi>Moab.</hi> Not onely the meaner sort of people, but the Princes also; yea and King himselfe, were to haue their portion in it: and that as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, as if they had alreadie had it. For <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> hath spoken it. For its added for a conclusion to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sayth the <hi>Lord.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> hath said it, that neither Prince nor King shall be extempt from his iudgements; but shall as well as the lowest of the people be cut off, and come to nought.</p>
               <p>The doctrine to be obserued from hence is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God exerciseth his iudgements, not onely vpon men of low and base estate, but also vpon the great ones of this world; vpon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth I haue heretofore confirmed vnto you, in my 21. Lecture, on the former Chapter, handling those words Chap. 1. vers. 15. <hi>Their King shall goe into captiuitie he, and his Princes together,</hi> I proued vnto you this doctrine, <hi>When God punisheth a nation with captiuitie for their sinnes, he spareth neither Priest, nor Prince, nor King.</hi> My now-doctrine for substance is the same, but more generall; <hi>God exerciseth his iudgements not onely vpon men of low &amp; base estate, but also vpon the great ones of this world; vpon Princes &amp; Kings.</hi> The vses.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1741:25"/>
               <p>One is to admonish the great and mightie ones of this world, that they presume not to sinne against the Lord, as if they were priuiledged by their greatnes, and might. There is no such priuiledge. He that is <hi>Lord</hi> ouer all, will spare no person. Princes, and Kings must feele the smart of his iudgements.</p>
               <p>A second vse is, to minister comfort to such as are of low and base estate. If the mightie by violence, and oppression grind your faces, and compasse you about, yet be not yee discouraged; God the iudge of all accepteth no persons. He in his good time will auenge your causes, be your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressours neuer so mightie. For Princes and Kings must feele the smart of his iudgements.</p>
               <p>A third vse is, a warning for our selues; that we set not our hearts vpon the outward things of this world, for as much as God, the Creator of all, will not respect vs for them. Dost thou glory in this that thou art a mightie man, or a rich man? For both, might and riches, Princes, and Kings are far beyond thee: yet must Princes and Kings feele the smart of Gods iudgements.</p>
               <p>Let vs make a fourth vse of this doctrine, euen to poure out our soules in thankefulnesse before almightie God, for his wonderfull patience towards vs. Our sinnes are as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as euer were the sinnes of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> Our three and foure transgressions, our many sinnes doe cry aloud to Heauen against vs, as the sins of the <hi>Moabites</hi> cryed against them. For their sinnes God sent a sword vpon them, and did cut them off from being a nation; Gods wrath against our sinnes, hath not yet proceeded so farre. We yet enioy our happie peace. Euery man dwels vnder his owne vine, and vnder his owne figtree; and liues in the habitations of his forefathers in peace, free from all feare of the enemies sword. Such is our condition, through the neuer-too-much admired patience of Almightie God. O let vs not despise the riches of the bountifulnesse, patience, and long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our God. S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tells vs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. That these doe lead vs to Repentance.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1741:26"/>
               <p>These doe lead vs; shall we not follow? Beloued, while we haue time, let vs betake our selues to Repentance. It was good counsaile which <hi>Iudith</hi> gaue to <hi>Ozias, Chabris,</hi> and <hi>Charmis</hi> the ancients of the cittie <hi>Bethulia. (Iudith</hi> 8.12.) <hi>Quia patiens Dominus est, in hoc ipso paniteamus, &amp; indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam eius fusis lachrymis postulemus.</hi> The counsaile is as good for vs. Beloued, because the <hi>Lord</hi> is patient, therefore let vs repent, and with shedding of teares beg of him indulgence, and pardon for our sinnes past. Its no wisedome for vs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer to presume vpon his patience. It is true <hi>Dominus patiens,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> is slow to anger; but the Prophet <hi>Nahum.</hi> Chap. 1.3. addeth also, that he is great in power, and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will not cleare the wicked.</p>
               <p>This long forbearance of God towards vs, <hi>patientia est, non negligentia:</hi> you must call it patience, it is not negligence. <hi>Non ille potentiam perdidit, sed nos ad poenitentiam reseruauit,</hi> saith S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>

               <p>OVr Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> hath hitherto dealt with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations, with the <hi>Syrians,</hi> with the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines,</hi> with the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> with the <hi>Edomites,</hi> with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and with the <hi>Moabites.</hi> Six in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. All borderers vpon, and professed enemies vnto the people of the <hi>Lord,</hi> the type of the Church. To each of these you haue heard the iudgements of God menaced, his punishments threatned: all which are accordingly fallen out.</p>
               <p>Was not <hi>Amos</hi> his message from the <hi>Lord</hi> to the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites?</hi> Why then doth he first foretell forraine nations their iudgements? The reasons are three;</p>
               <p>First, that he might be the more patiently heard of his Countrymen, friend, and allies, the <hi>Israelites.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> seeing their Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> so sharpe against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other their enemies, could not but the more quietly heare him, when he should prophecie against them also <hi>Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio quaedam est, afflictio inimici,</hi> It is some comfort to a naturall distressed man to see his enemie in distresse also.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1741:27"/>
               <p>Secondly, that they might haue no cause to wonder, if God should at any time come against them in vengeance, sith he would not spare the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other Nations, though destitute of the light of Gods word, and ignorant of his will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that they might the more stand in awe at the words of this prophecie, when they should behold the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and other their neighbours, afflicted and tormented, according to the haynousnesse of their iniquities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scitum est, ex alijs periculum facere, tibi quod ex vsu fiet.</hi> It is a principle in Natures Schoole, that we take example from other mens harmes, how to order our wayes. From this natures principle, the people of <hi>Israell</hi> might thus haue argued. Will not the <hi>Lord</hi> spare the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Moabites?</hi> How then can we presume that he will spare vs? They silly people neuer knew the holy will of God; yet shall they drinke of the cup of Gods wrath? How then shal we escape, who knowing Gods holy will, haue contemned it?</p>
               <p>You see now, good reason our Prophet had, (though sent with a message to the ten tribes of <hi>Israel</hi>) first to let for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations vnderstand Gods pleasure towards them in respect of their sinnes. From them he commeth to Gods owne peculiar people; diuided after the death of King <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> into two families, or kingdomes; <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi> First, he prophecieth against <hi>Iudah,</hi> in the 4. and 5. verses. <hi>Thus sayth the Lord, For three transgressions of</hi> Iudah, <hi>and for foure, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>of him,</hi> and <hi>in him,</hi> and <hi>by him</hi> are all things. Thirdly, it is the <hi>memoriall</hi> of God vnto all ages: so God himselfe cals it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.15. the <hi>memoriall</hi> of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, his truth, and his constancie in the performance of his promises. And therefore whensoeuer in any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, God promiseth, or threatneth any great matter, to assure vs of the most certaine euent thereof, he adds vnto it his name <hi>Iehovah.</hi> So here in my text: <hi>Thus sayth Iehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus sayth the Lord]</hi> not, <hi>Thus sayth Amos:</hi> but <hi>Thus saith the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> then is the author of this Scripture; and not of this onely, but also of the whole bodie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The doctrine,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The author of holy Scripture is neither man, nor Angell, nor any other creature, how eminent, or excellent soeuer, but onely the liuing, and immortall God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This doctrine I haue heretofore commended vnto you in my first lecture vpon this Chapter. The vses of it were three.</p>
               <p>The first concerned vs, whom God hath set apart to be the Preachers, and expounders of the Scriptures. We must handle them as the holy word of God. As my Prophet here comes to <hi>Iudah,</hi> so must we to you, with, <hi>thus saith the Lord,</hi> we may not speake, either the imagination of our <hi>owne braines,</hi> or the vaine perswasions of our <hi>owne hearts;</hi> we must sincerely preach vnto you Gods gracious word, without corrupting, or deprauing it.</p>
               <p>A second vse concerneth you, who are auditors, and hearers of the word preached. It is your parts to giue eare vnto it with attention and reuerence; and like the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians]</hi> commended by S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13.] to receiue it, not as the word of vs <hi>men:</hi> but, as it is indeed, the <hi>word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1741:28"/>
               <p>A third vse concerned the aduersaries of the truth; the <hi>Papists</hi> who doe vilifie, and debase the sacred Scriptures, and esteeme not of them, as of the <hi>word of God.</hi> How sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they haue loaded this <hi>holy word of God</hi> with disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full termes, calling it, <hi>a doubtful vncertaine, and a leaden rule, a poore kinde of element, a booke of discord, a matter of debate, dead inke, inken divinitie, a dumbe iudge, a nose of waxe, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops fables,</hi> I haue<note n="g" place="margin">Lect. <hi>2.</hi> in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos <hi>1.</hi> pag. <hi>18.</hi> &amp;c.</note> heretofore deliuered vnto you.</p>
               <p>But who are they, out of whose mouths, and pens, such bitternesse against Gods holy word hath beene vented? Are they our Countrymen? Are they not rather strangers to vs, <hi>Papists</hi> of other Nations? <hi>Pighius, Hosius, Gretser, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Lewis</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> the <hi>collocutors</hi> at <hi>Wormes,</hi> and <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon?</hi> What are these to vs? It may be our <hi>English Papists</hi> doe esteeme of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> more reuerently. More reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! Let one speake for all.

                  <hi>Peter</hi> thought much otherwise. He in his 2. Epist. and 1. Chapter, hauing proued the certaintie of Euangelicall doctrine, by two arguments, one drawne from his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the other from the testimonie of Almightie God in a voice from Heauen, <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17, 18. addeth <hi>vers.</hi> 19. a third argument, drawne from the consent of the <hi>Prophets: We haue also a most sure word of the Prophets, to the which yee doe well that ye take heed, as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place, vntill the day dawne, and the day star arise in your hearts. So that yee first know this, that no prophecie in the Scripture is of any priuate motion. For the prophecie came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were mooued by the Holy-Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where first, the blessed Apostle calls the writings of the Prophets <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>a most sure word.</hi> Secondly, he aduiseth vs to be diligently conuersant in those writings: <hi>yee shall doe well to take heed vnto them.</hi> Thirdly, he shewes the necessitie, and vse of them, by a comparison: <hi>they are as a light, that shineth in a darke place.</hi> Fourthly, he prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1741:29"/> the time of our diligence: we must <hi>take heed vnto them, vntill the day dawne, and the day starre arise in our hearts.</hi> Fiftly, he noteth their difficultie. <hi>Difficultas stimulus debet esse diligentiae;</hi> the more hard they are to be vnderstood, the greater must our diligence be: <hi>No prophecie in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of any priuate motion.</hi> It is not in mans power rightly to vnderstand the Prophets. The Treasurer to the Queene of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> confesseth as much. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.31.

               <p>What S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> in this place affirmeth of the Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Bookes, is true also of the Euangelicall, and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; what he affirmeth of the old testament, is true also of the new. The new and the old differ not in substance. <hi>In veteri Testamento est occultatio novi, &amp; in novo Testamento est manifestatio veteris.</hi> So saith S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Austin lib. de Catechizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis rudibus. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>In the old Testament the new is trid, and in the new the olde is manifested.</hi> The like the same good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath. <hi>Qu.</hi> 37. <hi>super Exodum: In vetere novum latet, &amp; in novo vetus patet:</hi> in the <hi>old</hi> the <hi>new</hi> is <hi>couered,</hi> and in the <hi>new</hi> the <hi>old</hi> is <hi>opened.</hi> Old and new, both doe agree in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.

               <p>The first pillars of the Primitiue Church, the auncient Fathers thought much otherwise. Because I cannot stand
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1741:30"/> long vpon this poynt, one shall serue for all. Sweete Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his ninth Sermon vpon the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> thus speaketh to his hearers: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>yee, my secular and lay auditors, heare me, I beseech you: Get you Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, your soules physicke: if you be vnwilling, to be at charge for the whole, yet at least buy the new Testament:</hi> the Euangelists, and Apostles will be your daily and diligent teachers. If any griefe befall you, make your repaire hither, as to an Apothecaries shop, here shall you haue varietie of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, fit to cure you. If any damage, if losse of friends, if death come, here may you finde comfort. In a word, the cause of all euill is, not to know the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You see how far this good Father is, from calling the <hi>Bible,</hi> a <hi>Booke of heresies,</hi> as some late <hi>Papists</hi> haue done: He holds it to be the greatest treasure this world hath, and thinkes it for you very expedient, to haue one of them in your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that at euery opportunitie, you may be reading in it.</p>
               <p>If any shall here obiect, I am towards the Law, I am em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about publike affaires, I am a tradesman, I am a marryed man, I haue children to maintaine, I haue a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie to care for, I haue worldly businesses to looke vnto, it is not my part to read the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> this office belongs to them rather, who haue bidden the world farewell: to such S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> shall answer <hi>Homil.</hi> 3. <hi>de Lazaro. Quid ait homo?</hi> What sayst thou man? Is it not a part of thy busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to turne ouer the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> because thou art distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many cares? <hi>Immo, tuum est magis, quam illorum.</hi> Yea the reading of the Scripture belongeth to thee, rather then to them, who haue bidden the world farewell, because they need not so much the helpe of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as you doe, who are as it were tossed in the waues of troubles.</p>
               <p>To conclude this poynt. Let Papists set light by the <hi>Sacred Scriptures;</hi> let them debase, vilifie, and disgrace them to their owne vtter confusion and perdition: wee, through Gods goodnesse, haue learned a better lesson: that the word of God, which we call <hi>Scripture,</hi> is<note n="o" place="margin">Chrysos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The word of God (which we call Scripture) it is his most royall and Celestiall Testament, it is the Oracle of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Sanctuary, it is the onely Key, vnto vs, of his reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led counsels, it is Milke from his sacred brests, the Earnest and Pledge of his fauour to the Church, the Light of our feet, the Ioy of our hearts, the Breath of our nostrils, the Pillar of our faith, the Anchor of our hope, the ground of our loue, the Euidence of our future blessednesse.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, as the Elect of God, holy and beloued, let this word of God dwell plenteously in you, in all wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: frequent this place to heare it read and expounded vnto you: and at home teach and admonish your owne selues in Psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall songs. My exhortation is the same, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> made vnto the <hi>Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, Chap.</hi> 3.16. Thus much of the preface. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie followeth.</p>
               <p>The first part thereof is a generall accusation of <hi>Iudah: For three transgressions of Iudah, and for foure.</hi> Wherein we are first to consider <hi>who are the accused,</hi> in the name, <hi>Iudah.</hi> Secondly, <hi>whereof they are accused; For three transgressions, and for foure.</hi> First of the <hi>accused.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>accused</hi> are the inhabitants of the Kingdome of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> The Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> is taken sometimes <hi>latè,</hi> sometimes <hi>strictè:</hi> sometimes in a <hi>large,</hi> sometimes in a <hi>strict sense.</hi> In the <hi>large,</hi> it betokeneth all the twelue tribes of <hi>Israel:</hi> in the <hi>strict sense,</hi> it betokeneth onely two tribes; <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> at first were but one kingdome, which afteward was diuided into two; the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi>

                  </gap>, the foolishnesse of the people, and one that had no vnderstanding, succeeding in his fathers throne, did, vpon aduise giuen him by his young counsellours, promise sharpe vsage and hard measure vnto his people: <hi>My least part, my little finger shall be bigger then my fathers loynes: whereas my father did burden you with a grieuous yoke, I will make it heauier: my father hath chastized you with rods, but I will correct you with scourges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This his vnkinde and euill entreating of a people, which of late, in King <hi>Salomons</hi> time, saw good and peaceable daies, did cause a rebellion and reuolt.

               <p>Thus you see, <hi>Israel</hi> diuided from <hi>Israel:</hi> ten tribes from the other two. Two tribes; the tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> continued in their obedience to the house of <hi>Dauid:</hi> the other ten tribes forsooke it, and fell away.</p>
               <p>The ten reuolted tribes haue diuerse appellations in the sanctified writings of the holy Prophets: <hi>Bethel, Bethauen, Samaria, Iezreel, Ioseph, Ephraim, Iacob, Israel:</hi> these names are appropriate, to signifie the <hi>Kingdome of Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other two tribes, <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> called but one tribe in the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.13. because of the mixture of their possessions, these two tribes setled in their faithfulnes and obedience to the seede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> haue likewise in the sacred Scriptures their diuers appellations.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudah</hi> is one of these appellations, and that is the <hi>Iudah</hi> in my text, <hi>properly,</hi> vers. 5. <hi>I will send a fire vpon Iudah,</hi> that is, vpon the <hi>Kingdome of Iudah.</hi> And by a figure, in this first branch of this prophesie, where <hi>Iudah</hi> is put for the <hi>inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the kingdom of Iudah.</hi> Thus haue you the parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, the inhabitants of the kingdom of <hi>Iudah.</hi> But wherof are they accused?

               <p>What are these three and foure transgressions? <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> makes three of them to bee, <hi>man-slaughter, incest,</hi> and <hi>idolatry:</hi> The first is <hi>man-slaughter. Esay</hi> poynts at it, chap. 1.15. <hi>Your hands are full of bloud.</hi> The second is <hi>incest. Ieremie</hi> poynts at it, chap. 23.10. <hi>the land is full of adulterers.</hi> The third is <hi>idolatry. Hoseah</hi> poynts at it, chap. 1.2. <hi>The land hath committed great whoredome, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Lord.</hi> The fourth, which of all, is the most flagicious and hainous, is expressed in this text; and it is their reiecting, abolishing, or disanulling of Gods lawes and commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For three transgressions of Iudah, and for foure.] Albertus</hi> the Great, B. of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> will haue three of these transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to be expressed in this text. The first of them is, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis abiectio,</hi> the abiection, or contempt of Gods Law: <hi>They haue desp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sed the law of the Lord.</hi> The second is, <hi>praeceptorum non obseruatio,</hi> the not obseruing of Gods commandements: <hi>They haue not kept his commandements.</hi> The third is, <hi>ad Idola conuersio:</hi> their conuersion to Idols: <hi>Their lies caused them to erre, after which their fathers haue walked.</hi> These three you see expressed in the text. But what is the fourth? It is <hi>Sacrati loci prophanatio,</hi> the prophanation of the hallowed place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For three transgressions of Iudah, and for foure] Paulus de Palatio</hi> doth otherwise descant vpon these <hi>three and foure transgressions.</hi> The first he will haue to be committed by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam,</hi> son of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> who to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe strong in his Kingdome, slue with the sword six of his brethren, and some of the Princes of <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 21.4.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1741:32"/> The second by <hi>Ioash,</hi> sonne of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> who allured by the flattery of some of his Princes, slew <hi>Zacharias,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iehoiada:</hi> or <hi>Barachias,</hi> betweene the temple and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35. The third, by King <hi>Amaziah,</hi> who, lifted vp with pride for his victory obtained against the <hi>Edomites,</hi> did prouoke the King of <hi>Israel</hi> to fight, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.17. Thus haue you <hi>three</hi> of these <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</hi> The <hi>fourth,</hi> saith this <hi>Paulus de Palatio,</hi> needes no enquiry. And why so? <hi>Amos</hi> in this text declares it. The Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> from <hi>Rehoboams</hi> time was most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense vnto idolatry: from that time, they <hi>cast away the law of the Lord,</hi> they <hi>kept not his commandements,</hi> they <hi>serued Idols, after which their fathers walked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For three transgressions of Iudah, and for foure]</hi> This phrase we met with fiue times in the former chapter, and once in this. The most naturall, proper, and significant expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, heeretofore commended vnto you, is this: to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by <hi>three and foure,</hi> many. A number finite and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, is put for a number infinite and vncertaine. <hi>For three transgressions of Iudah, and for foure;</hi> that is, for many trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions. As oft, as hee will, God forgiueth, though wee sinne many a time. It is but the custome of the <hi>Scripture</hi> thus to speake: God waiteth for vs <hi>twice and thrice,</hi> that is, a good while, to haue vs returne from our euill wayes vnto repentance: but the <hi>fourth</hi> time, that is, at length, when he seeth vs persist in our impenitency, hee protesteth against vs, as heere against <hi>Iudah, I will not turne to you,</hi> I will not turne away your punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will not turne away the punishment thereof]</hi> These words are diuersly rendered: by <hi>Gualter, non conuertam eum,</hi> I will not turne <hi>Iudah,</hi> I will not recall him into the right way; he shall runne to his owne perdition. By <hi>Mercer: non par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam ei,</hi> I will not spare <hi>Iudah:</hi> according as his desert shall be, so shall he haue. In our English-<hi>Geneua</hi> translation, <hi>I will not turne to it.</hi> In our late Church-Bible, <hi>I will not spare him.</hi> In our newest translation, <hi>I will not turne away the punishment thereof.</hi> So read <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1741:32"/> according to the Hebrew, <hi>Non auertam istud,</hi> I will not turne away this punishment, which I haue resolued to lay vpon <hi>Iudah.</hi> The summe of both accusation and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station is this. If <hi>Iudah</hi> had sinned but once, or a second time, I would haue beene fauourable to them, and would haue recalled him into the right way, that so they might haue been conuerted, and might haue escaped my punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but now whereas they doe daily heape transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon transgression, and make no end of sinning, I haue hardened my face against them, I will not turne them vnto me, I will not turne to them, I will not spare them, I will not turne away the punishment, which I haue resolued to bring vpon them; but indurate and obstinate, as they are, I will vtterly destroy them. <hi>For three transgressions of Iudah, and for foure, I will not turne away the punishment thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus haue you the exposition of the two first parts of this prophecie; of the <hi>accusation</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the Lords <hi>protestation</hi> against them. Now let vs see what doctrin may bee taken hence for our further instruction, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our liues. Doth God resolue to punish <hi>Iudah,</hi> for <hi>three &amp; foure trāgressions?</hi> The doctrin arising hence is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three transgressions, and foure,</hi> that is, many sinnes, <hi>doe prouoke Almighty God to lay his punishments vpon vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is of pure eyes, and beholdeth no iniquity. Hee hath layd righteousnesse to the rule, and weighed his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in a ballance. His sentence is passed forth, and stands, like the law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> irreuocable: Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguish, vpon euery soule that doth euill. The soule that sinneth, it selfe must beare the punishment. God makes it good with an oath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41. that hee <hi>will whet his glittering sword, and his hand shall take hold on iudgement, to execute vengeance</hi> for sinne. His soule hateth, and abhorreth sinne; his law curseth and condemneth sinne; his hand smiteth and scourgeth sinne. Sinne was his motiue to cast Angels out of Heauen, to thrust <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise, to turne Cities into ashes, to ruinate Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to torment his owne bowels in the similitude of sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1741:33"/> flesh. Sinne made him heretofore to drowne the olde world; and sinne will make him hereafter to burne this. So true is my doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many sinnes doe prouoke Almighty God to lay his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs now make some vse of this doctrine.</p>
               <p>Doe many sinnes cause Almighty God to punish vs? First, we are hence taught, at what time soeuer God shall lay his rod vpon vs, to seeke the true cause thereof in our selues. <hi>Malorum omnium nostrorum causa, peccatum est,</hi> saith S. <hi>Austin,</hi> Serm. 139. <hi>de Tempore.</hi> The cause of all euill is within vs: it is sinne within vs. It is impiety to imagine, that God will punish vs without a cause. <hi>Non pateremur, nisi mereremur,</hi> saith that good Father; We should not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe any crosse or disturbance, vnlesse wee deserued it. Wherefore let vs, euery one of vs in particular, when God commeth neere to vs in iudgement, to touch, either our estates with want, or our callings with disgrace, or our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with sicknes, or our soules with heauines; let vs haue recourse to the sinnes within vs, which haue deserued this, and turne we to the <hi>Lord</hi> our God. Water, teares, sorrow, repentance, will better satisfie him, pacifie him, mooue him, alter him, then whatsoeuer vengeance, or plagues, or bloud, or death.</p>
               <p>Let vs enter into a due consideration of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our transgressions, our sinnes, wherewith, as with a heauy burden, wee are laden: and returne wee to the <hi>Lord</hi> our God: adulterers, murtherers, idolaters, the sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the ambitious, the couetous, drunkards, railers, lyars, the blasphemous, swearers, forswearers, all, who by any their euill wayes prouoke God to the execution of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, must take part in this conuersion. Let no man draw backe; let not the heinousnesse of our fore-passed sinnes deterre vs or keepe vs, from so holy a course. I dare affirme with S. <hi>Austin</hi> Serm. 181. <hi>de Tempore. Non nocent peccata praeterita, si non placent praesentia.</hi> Sinnes past hurt not, if sins present please not. Let vs euen now at this present in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1741:33"/> of sinne resolue to sinne willingly no more, and our sinnes past shall neuer hurt vs. O let not this vse slip out of our minds. When God his heauy hand is vpon vs in any crosse or tribulation, seeke wee out the cause of it in our selues, in our sinnes.</p>
               <p>A second vse followeth: and it is to stirre vs vp to a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contemplation of the wonderfull patience of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, who did so graciously forbeare those inhabitants of <hi>Iudah,</hi> till by their <hi>three transgressions,</hi> and by their <hi>foure,</hi> they had prouoked God vnto displeasure. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are frequent in proclaiming God to be <hi>mercifull,</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> and <hi>long-suffering,</hi> and <hi>of great goodnesse.</hi> Hee cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the foolish, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.22. <hi>O ye foolish, how long will ye loue foolishnesse?</hi> He cryeth to the faithlesse, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.17. <hi>O generation, faithlesse and crooked, how long now shall I suffer you?</hi> He cryeth to <hi>Ierusalem, Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Ierusalem, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, how often?</hi> What could the Lord haue done more vnto his vineyard, then he had done vnto it? He dressed it with the best and kindliest husbandry that his heart could inuent, as appeareth, <hi>Esa.</hi> 5.2. Such carefull dressing could not but deserue fruit. This fruit he required not at the first houre, but tarried for it the full time, euen till the autumne and time of vintage; if then it failed, did it not deserue to be eaten vp? Looke into the 13. of <hi>Luke</hi> vers. 6. There shall you see the Lord wayting three yeeres for the fruit of his fig-tree, yea and content, that digging, and dunging, and expectation a fourth yeere may bee bestowed vpon it. Doubtlesse God is <hi>mercifull,</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> and <hi>long suffering,</hi> and <hi>of great goodnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heereof (Beloued) we haue great experience. We haue our <hi>three transgressions,</hi> and our <hi>foure</hi> too, as <hi>Iudah</hi> had. Our manifold sinnes, our sins of omission, and our sinnes of commission, our sinnes of ignorance, and our sinnes of wilfulnesse, our sinnes of infirmity, and our sinnes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, doe they not day by day, impudently and saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily presse into the presence of Gods Maiesty, to procure his vengeance against vs? And yet wee must needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1741:34"/> it, God is <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>patient</hi> towards vs.</p>
               <p>Beloued, let vs not abuse so great goodnes and patience of our God. Though some fall seauen times a day, and rise againe; though to some sinners it pleaseth God to ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his sufferance, as vpon vs hitherto he hath done; yet should not we herevpon presume to iterate our misdoings.

                  <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> for <hi>once</hi> lying to the Holy Ghost. God is now as able, as euer he was, euen for <hi>one</hi> transgression to cut vs of; but if he patiently forbeare vs, till by <hi>three</hi> and <hi>foure</hi> transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, by our many sinnes, we grieue the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of that <hi>Sacred Maiestie,</hi> shall we thinke (as some impiously doe) that God takes no notice of the sinnes, which we commit, or cares not for them? Far let all such conceit be from any Christian heart.</p>
               <p>Let vs rather confesse the truth: that God by such his forbearance doth lead vs to repentance: for as much as it is impossible, that God should be, and not see; should see, and not regard; should regard, and not punish; should punish, and not proportion his punishments to our sinnes. I grant that the iustice of God goeth on <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in order: but for the most part it recompenseth the slacknes of iudgement with the heauinesse thereof. It keepes the rule full well; to render for ripe sinnes, ripe plagues; for great sinnes, great plagues; for grieuous sins, grieuous plagues.</p>
               <p>The rule in the Scholes is thus deliuered. <hi>Culpam poena sequitur,</hi> euery sinne hath a due punishment attending it. God is without exception iust: and therefore <hi>Grauitas sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicij, grauitatem peccati denotat;</hi> grieuous punishments wheresoeuer God shall lay them, doe argue grieuous sins of those places, and persons. Let no man then, that groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1741:34"/> vnder any crosse, affliction, or tribulation, complaine of his hard hap, or ill fortune; all such visitations are from God, and for our sinnes. And if we will stay Gods hand from correcting vs, we must stay our selues from sinning, and offending him. I conclude with <hi>S. Pauls</hi> exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Romanes, chap.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Let not sinne reigne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your mortall bodies; obey it not in the lusts thereof; giue not your members, as weapons of vnrighteousnesse vnto sin; but, as men aliue from the dead, giue your selues vnto God, that being freed from sinne, and made Gods seruants through Iesus Christ, you may haue your fruit in holinesse, and the end euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi>

               <p>THE third part of this prophecie against <hi>Iudah</hi> is now to be examined: namely the enumeration of some particular sinnes, whereby the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Iudah</hi> prouoked their God vnto displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The first passage in this part is: <hi>They haue despised the law of the Lord.</hi> Where we haue, the sinne of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the obiect thereof; the sinne, <hi>contempt;</hi> the obiect, <hi>the law of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>They haue despised:</hi> there is the sinne. <hi>The law of the Lord:</hi> there is the obiect. First of the sinne, of the contempt.</p>

                  <hi>Contempt</hi> is an action of the minde, by which we nothing at all, or very lightly esteeme of a thing, and therefore doe reiect it. This action, which I call <hi>contempt,</hi> is partly from the vnderstanding, partly from the will. First the vnderstanding esteemes a thing to be nothing or litle worth; then doth the will reiect it, and casts it away.</p>
               <p>A thing may be <hi>contemned</hi> two manner of wayes; either simply, or in respect of some other thing.</p>
               <p>First simply. So we may <hi>contemne</hi> a vile fellow, one that hath no vertue, no goodnes in him; one that is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither vicious, giuen vp<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28.</note> to a reprobate sense, to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, to wantonnesse, to worke all kinde of wickednes, euen with greedinesse. Such a fellow, is simply vnworthy to be had in any the least estimation. Such we may, we
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1741:35"/> must <hi>contemne.</hi> In like sort, if a tyrant command, that which is vniust, any thing that is derogatorie to the glory of God, and threatneth grieuous punishments, vnlesse he be obeyed: in this case a good Christian, must be of a stout courage; he must <hi>despise</hi> the vniust command, and the proud threats of the tyrant; his zeale must be only for the glory of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The storie of the three children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. is not vnknowne to you. The King of <hi>Babylon, Nabuchodonozor</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.1.</note> set vp a golden image, and commanded it to be worshipped. His decree was, that<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>euery one, that should heare the sound of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, shawme, psalterie, dulcimer, and other instruments of musicke, should fall downe, and worship the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den image:</hi> who so fell not downe, and worshipped, <hi>hee should be cast into the middest of a hot fiery furnace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This vniust decree of the King, the three children, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach, Misach, and Abednego,</hi> regarded not: they could not be brought to worship this golden image; they feared not his hot fiery fornace; they knew, God was<note n="d" place="margin">

                  <hi>able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them</hi> from thence; if God would not, yet were they resolued in no wise to worship that image: they would not so much as outwardly consent to idolatry; so zealous were they for the glory of God. A worthy example for my present purpose, to shew, that the <hi>vniust commands</hi> of Tyrants, are very iustly <hi>contemned</hi> and <hi>reiected.</hi> So are the commands of Magistrates, Parents, and other superiours in authoritie, if they depriue God of his glory. If they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish, remit, or abate any thing of the glory of God, they are simply to be <hi>contemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You see now; a thing may be contemned <hi>simpliciter,</hi> simply. It may also be contemned <hi>secundum quid,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of some other thing: as when a man esteemes more of his pleasure, or profit, then of the law of the <hi>Lord.</hi> Such an one may be said <hi>secundum quid,</hi> in respect of his owne pleasure, or profit, to <hi>contemne the law of the Lord.</hi> And this <hi>contempt</hi> is a sin. The fore-mentioned <hi>contempts,</hi> were not sinnes. A <hi>contempt</hi> may be a sinne, or not a sinne. You
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1741:36"/> may discerne it by its <hi>obiect,</hi> or the thing <hi>contemned.</hi> If the <hi>obiect,</hi> if the thing <hi>contemned</hi> be euill, then is the <hi>contempt</hi> good; it is a vertue, its no sinne. It is no sinne to <hi>contemne</hi> a vicious fellow, in whom there is no sparke of pietie: its no sinne to <hi>contemne</hi> the impious and vniust commands of men placed in authoritie aboue vs, as you haue already heard. But if the <hi>obiect,</hi> if the thing <hi>contemned</hi> be good, then is the <hi>contempt</hi> euill, it is a vice, its a sinne. Such was this contempt of <hi>Iuda,</hi> for <hi>they despised the law of the Lord.</hi> You see their sinne, <hi>Contempt.</hi> Now see the <hi>Obiect.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>law of the Lord</hi> so far surpassing all other <hi>lawes</hi> for the excellencie thereof, these inhabitants of <hi>Iudah</hi> did <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise;</hi> they <hi>contemned</hi> it.

<q>The contempt of the law of the Lord is a very grieuous sinne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This truth will be plaine, if you will consider, what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments God in his holy word threatneth and layeth vpon the <hi>despisers,</hi> or <hi>contemners</hi> of his Sacred Maiestie, of his ceremonies, of his commandements, of his holy word.</p>
               <p>Such <hi>despisers,</hi> or <hi>contemners,</hi> are <hi>an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 3.32. <hi>The Lord will despise them,</hi> 1.

<q>The contempt of the law of the Lord is a very grieuous sinne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You see the doctrine. Let vs now make some vse of it to our selues.</p>

               <p>But if we wilfully <hi>breake the law of the Lord:</hi> if we haue no feare, nor feeling of the iudgements threatned in that his <hi>holy law:</hi> if we runne on securely in our vngodly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: if we prostitute our selues to all vncleannesse: if we be filled with<note n="s" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs, let euery one of vs, enter into the closet of our own hearts: examine we our selues, how we haue heretofore stood, and how we do now stand, affected to the <hi>law of the Lord</hi> Iudge we our selues, that we be not iudged of the <hi>Lord;</hi> condemne we our selues, that we be not condemned of the <hi>Lord.</hi> If we finde our selues hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to haue bin<note n="x" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.</note>

               <p>Thus farre of the sinne of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as it is expressed in the first branch of this third part of my text: <hi>They haue despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1741:38"/> the law of the Lord.</hi> The doctrine grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, was this:
<q>The contempt of the law of the Lord is a very grieuous sinne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The vse made thereof vnto our selues, was to stirre vp in vs a desire of conforming our obedience to <hi>this law of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sinne of <hi>Iudah,</hi> is further expressed in the next clause: <hi>They haue not kept his Commandements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commandements]</hi> The word in the originall, and <hi>Hebrew</hi> fountaine is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, his <hi>mandats</hi> or <hi>commandements.</hi> So, this clause is but an exposition of the former. The same thing is twise said: 1. <hi>They haue despised the law of the Lord.</hi> 2. <hi>They haue not kept his commandements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is the same thing twise said? Let it be true, that by <hi>the lawes of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the commandements of the Lord,</hi> one and the same thing be vnderstood: is it likewise all one, <hi>to despise,</hi> and <hi>not to keepe?</hi> or doth not our Prophet say lesse against the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> where he saith, <hi>They haue not kept the commandements of the Lord,</hi> then when he saith, <hi>They haue despised the law of the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He may seeme to say lesse. But if we consider the force of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phrase, we shall finde it to be otherwise. It is a rule,<note n="y" place="margin">Drusius.</note>
                  <hi>Hebraei per negationem contrarij vehementiùs affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant:</hi> the Hebrewes by denying the contrary doe the more vehemently affirme. It may thus appeare. <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Prouerbs, chap.</hi> 17.21. saith, <hi>Non gaudet stulti pater,</hi> the father of a foole reioyceth not. This may seeme to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1741:38"/> be but coldly and slenderly spoken, not sufficiently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse that griefe, which fathers do conceiue at the <hi>disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> of their sonnes, which the Wiseman there calleth <hi>foolishnes.</hi> But the phrase is very forcible; <hi>Non gaudet stulti pater;</hi> the father of a foole reioyceth not. <hi>Nemo quisquam vnquā ita dolet, quin idem aliquādo gaudeat,</hi> saith<note n="o" place="margin">Drus. obseruat. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> a learned writer. There is scarse any man euer so grieued, but that at some one time, or other, he reioyceth: but if a man at all times, and euery moment of time be grieued, of him we may truly say, <hi>Non gaudet,</hi> he reioyceth not. <hi>Non gaudet stulti pater:</hi> It is very fitly englished in our new translation: <hi>The father of a foole hath no ioy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you, you who liue vnder the rule of your parents, be ye sonnes, or daughters, liuing vnder father, or mother, if you behaue your selues <hi>disobediently</hi> towards your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in <hi>Salomons</hi> account you are <hi>fooles;</hi> and your <hi>Parents can haue no ioy in you.</hi> And, tell me, of whom should your Parents haue ioy, if not of you their children? <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>A like phrase the same <hi>Salomon</hi> hath, <hi>Prou.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Non prosunt thesauri improbitatis:</hi> The treasures of wickednes profit not. This may seeme to be spoken but jeiunely, and sleightly, not sufficiently to expresse the hurt &amp; mischiefe, that shall befall a man, for his goods vnlawfully, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly gotten. But the phrase is very forcible, <hi>Non prosunt thesauri improbitatis,</hi> the treasures of wickednes profit not. <hi>Quod in omni tempori nocet</hi> sayth<note n="p" place="margin">Drusius, vbi suprà.</note> one, <hi>de eo verissimè enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatur, non prodest.</hi> Name any thing, that at all times is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

But the phrase here is very forcible. <hi>Non obseruârunt mandata eius:</hi> They haue not kept his commaundements. Here is implied <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>We see now, what it is, that our Prophet in this branch of my text, reprooueth in the people of <hi>Iudah;</hi> It is a <hi>Non obseruârunt</hi> a non obseruance, an vniuersall <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>commandements</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi> They tooke license to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, to innouate, to frame vnto themselues a new kind of diuine worship; such as the <hi>Lord</hi> neuer approoued, yea, such as was contrarie to the expresse will of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and was forbidden by him. From this reproofe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> we may take this lesson:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obedience to the commandements of the Lord, is a dutie which the Lord requireth to be performed by euery childe of his.</hi> This truth is made as plaine, as the light at noone day, by the words of blessed <hi>Samuel</hi> to king <hi>Saul.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings, and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: and to hearken then the fat of Rams. For rebellion is as the sinne of witchcraft, and stubbornnesse is as iniquitie, and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie.</hi> In which words of <hi>Samuel,</hi> we haue the nature of two contraries, <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>disobedience,</hi> excellently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1741:40"/> The one to be better then <hi>sacrifice:</hi> the other to be as <hi>witchcraft</hi> and <hi>idolatrie.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> whether the word of the Lord, shall be harkened to, yea, or no. Thus we set vp an Idol, within our owne brests against the God of Heauen, and despising, forsaking, not keeping his commandements, we follow the voice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of our owne deuises.</p>
               <p>To this place of <hi>Samuel</hi> (though of it selfe it be sufficient for the establishment of my propounded doctrine: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Obedience to the commandements of the Lord, is a dutie which the Lord requireth to be performed by euery child of his</hi>) let vs adde some other passages of holy Scripture, wherein the Lord to draw vs to this dutie of obedience, promiseth vs blessings.</p>
               <p>Memorable is that protestation of <hi>Moses</hi> to the children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Deut. 11.26. <hi>Behold, I set before you this day a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and a curse. A blessing if ye obey the commandements of the Lord your God; a curse, if ye obey them not.</hi> As if hee had thus said. Bethinke your selues, <hi>O ye children of Israel.</hi> Seeing God hath commaunded me to publish his law vnto you, it is not for you to fal asleepe. He sheweth you, how you may <hi>prosper</hi> all your life long, namely, <hi>if you will obey him.</hi> Obey him, and prosper all your life long. Is not this a great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing? But if you obey him not, the curse will ouertake.</p>
               <p>This doth <hi>Moses</hi> more particularly deliuer, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.1. <hi>If,</hi> saith he, <hi>thou shalt hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God, to obserue and keepe all his commandements:</hi> that is, if yee hearken to the Lords voyce, to obey his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and be carefull to keepe them, <hi>then shall you be blessed</hi>

               <p>What vse shall we now make of this Doctrine? This
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1741:41"/> needs no great consultation.

               <p>IN my last Sermon I began the exposition of the third part of this prophecie against <hi>Iudah,</hi> and passed ouer the two first branches. You then heard the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> reproued, for <hi>contempt,</hi> and <hi>rebellion:</hi> Contempt <hi>of the law of the Lord,</hi> and rebellion <hi>against his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>
                  <hi>Their lyes caused them to erre, after the which their fathers haue walked.]</hi> In steed of <hi>lyes,</hi> the vulgar Latin hath <hi>Idola,</hi> Idols. So hath <hi>S. Hierome: Deceperunt eos Idola eorum;</hi> their Idols haue deceiued them. What <hi>Idols?</hi> Euen such as <hi>their fathers</hi> followed, while they liued in Aegypt. They fashioned vnto themselues, the semblance and counterfeit of the <hi>Aegyptian Oxe;</hi> they adored <hi>Beelphegor,</hi> they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped <hi>Astaroth</hi> and <hi>Baalim. Beelphegor, Astaroth, Baalim;</hi> these were the <hi>Idols,</hi> as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> commenteth, by which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1741:43"/> the inhabitants of <hi>Iudah</hi> were deceiued: <hi>Deceperunt eos idola eorum;</hi> their Idols deceiued them.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Idols,</hi> our <hi>English</hi> translation readeth <hi>Lyes.</hi> The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> fountaine is our warrant: the word there signifieth <hi>Lyes. Their Lyes caused them to erre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyes</hi> are of two sorts: some are <hi>in commercijs;</hi> some <hi>in cultu divino:</hi> some in commerce with men; some in the seruice or worship of God. <hi>Lyes</hi> in commerce with men, are cōmitted 3. manner of wayes, in <hi>words,</hi> in <hi>manners,</hi> in things. <hi>A Lye in words</hi> is, when we speake one thing, &amp; thinke another: and this is either <hi>iocosum,</hi> or <hi>officiosum,</hi> or <hi>perniciosum;</hi> it is either a <hi>lye</hi> in iest, or an officious <hi>lye,</hi> or a pernicious <hi>lye;</hi> not one of these can be excused: no, not <hi>the lye in iest,</hi> though <hi>S. Austin</hi> call it <hi>otiosum,</hi> an idle lye; and exempteth it from blame: as also some do <hi>officiosum,</hi> the officious lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Lye in manners</hi> you may call <hi>simulation, dissimulation, counterfeiting, dissembling.</hi> This is seene in false-Christs, false-Prophets, false-Apostles, false-Teachers, such as make a faire shew of honestie, or for a<note n="i" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>The lye in things</hi> is, when one thing is substituted or put in the place of another; a counterfeit for a true thing: as when a cosener sells <hi>opium</hi> for <hi>apium,</hi> or <hi>broome twigs</hi> for <hi>balmewood,</hi> or <hi>alchimie</hi> for <hi>siluer,</hi> or <hi>copper</hi> for <hi>gold.</hi> But these <hi>lyes</hi> obuious and frequent in <hi>commerce with man,</hi> I must passe ouer. They are not intended in my text. The <hi>lyes</hi> intended in my text, are lyes <hi>in cultu divino,</hi> lyes in the seruice and worship of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their lyes caused them to erre.]</hi> These <hi>lyes in the seruice and worship of God,</hi> what are they? <hi>Lyranus</hi> will tell you. <hi>Quaecun{que} fiunt, aut cogitantur sine Dei verbo;</hi> Whatsoeuer things in diuine worship are done or deuised without the warrant of Gods word, they are <hi>lyes.</hi> So saith, that learned
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1741:44"/> Professor of <hi>Paris, Mercer; Omnia humana figmenta, quae contra Dei verbum, in Dei cultu excogitantur;</hi> All humane inventions in diuine worship deuised contrary to the word of God, <hi>they are lyes.</hi> Summarily thus I say: By <hi>lyes</hi> in this place we are to vnderstand, <hi>fictitios cultus,</hi> whatsoeuer worship of God is forged or counterfeited;<note n="l" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Their lyes caused them to erre.]</hi> First, they betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Idolatrie of the Gentiles, they made their sons <hi>to passe through the fire, according to the abominations of the Heathen,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 16.3. Secondly, they forsooke the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Lords house, his holy Temple at Ierusalem, and <hi>sacrificed, and burnt incense, in high places, on hills, vnder euery greene tree,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 16.4. Thirdly, <hi>they</hi>

                     <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.11.</note>
                  <hi>increased their Altars,</hi> multiplied their sacrifices, and augmented their ceremonies, supposing thereby <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> euen for such their superstition sake, to demerit vnto themselues the fauor of God, though they were vtterly voide of faith, and repentance. These were the <hi>lyes</hi> that deceiued <hi>Iudah;</hi> these <hi>their lyes caused them to erre. Commenta falsi cultus:</hi> their new-deuised, feigned, and forged worships of God, were the <hi>lyes,</hi> that <hi>caused them to erre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appellation of <hi>lyes</hi> is also giuen to false worship, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. where <hi>S. Paul</hi> chargeth the Gentiles, with <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the truth of God into a lye. They changed the truth of God into a lye,</hi> that is, the true worship of God they peruerted, and changed into false worship. The reason why false worship there is called a lye, is, because its opposed to truth.<note n="n" place="margin">Drusius.</note>
                  <hi>Quicquid veritati contrarium est, mendacium est;</hi> Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is contrary to truth, that is a lye. And therefore our Prophet here in this text opposeth <hi>lyes,</hi> to <hi>the law of God;</hi> because <hi>Lex Dei veritas, Psal.</hi> 119 142. the law of God is truth. This antithesis betweene <hi>the law of God,</hi> and <hi>a Lye,</hi> we finde, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.163. <hi>Mendacium odi, imme detestatus sum; legem tuam diligo.</hi> I hate <hi>a Lye;</hi> yea I abhorre it, but <hi>thy Law</hi> do I loue.</p>

               <p>We see now, what these lyes were, which caused <hi>Iudah</hi> to erre: they were humane deuises, and inuentions in the worship of God, defiling and infecting the sinceritie of that worship, which God onely approueth. And yet is the Holy Spirit here pleased further to notifie vnto vs these <hi>Lyes</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in these words: <hi>After the which their fathers walked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their Lyes caused them to erre; after the which their fathers haue walked.]</hi> What <hi>fathers</hi> meaneth he? Those, which<note n="o" place="margin">

                  <hi>made them a calfe in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image, and turned their glory,</hi> euen their God, <hi>into the similitude of an Oxe that eateth grasse?</hi> of whom we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4. Or meaneth he those which <hi>serued strange Gods</hi> in <hi>Ʋr</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees?</hi> of whom we read, <hi>Iosuah</hi> 24.2. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the <hi>Fathers</hi> were, here meant by our Prophet; they were to these inhabitants of <hi>Iudah</hi> their <hi>ancestors;</hi> they were their <hi>forefathers:</hi> such as tooke delight in <hi>the seruice of false Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their Lyes caused them to erre after the which their fathers walked.]</hi> It is no new thing, no strange thing, for <hi>children</hi> to striue to imitate their <hi>fathers,</hi> that they may be like vnto them. This doth <hi>S. Stephen, Act.</hi> 7.51. obiect to the successors of these Iewes: <hi>Yee stiffe-necked and vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in heart and eares, yee doe alwaies resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so doe yee.</hi> Your <hi>Fathers</hi> were a <hi>stiffe-necked people;</hi> so are yee. Your <hi>Fathers</hi> were of <hi>vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised hearts and eares;</hi> so are yee. Your <hi>Fathers resisted the Holy Ghost;</hi> so do yee. <hi>Yee stiffe-necked and vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in heart and eares, ye do alwayes resist the Holy Ghost; as your Fathers did, so do ye.</hi> By <hi>Fathers</hi> in this place the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyr <hi>S. Stephen</hi> meaneth <hi>maiores,</hi> their predecessors, their ancestors, their fore fathers.</p>
               <p>What? Are these words of <hi>S. Stephen</hi> extended to all the ancestors of the Iewes? Were they <hi>all</hi> a stiffe-necked people? Were they <hi>all</hi> of vncircumcised hearts and eares? Did they <hi>all</hi> resist the Holy Ghost? This may not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. The many and glorious titles, and appellations
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1741:45"/> bestowed vpon that people in Sacred Writ do euidently make good the contrary. We must therefore distinguish of those ancestors, and forefathers. Some of them were excellent men, and sincere worshippers of the true God: such were <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and all the faithfull, that issued out of their loynes: these are not the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whom <hi>S. Stephen</hi> meaneth. Other some there were notoriously infamous for their impietie, for their bloudy tyrannie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lords Prophets, for their idolatrous seruice of false Gods. And these <hi>S. Stephen</hi> in his speech intendeth.</p>
               <p>These are they who in the 78. <hi>Psal. vers.</hi> 8. are called, <hi>a stubborne and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright;</hi> a generation, <hi>whose spirit was not sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast with God.</hi> These are they, who <hi>S.

                  <hi>They walked after Lyes.]</hi> To <hi>walke,</hi> in the Scripture phrase is metaphorically taken, and hath diuers significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For the vnderstanding of the phrase in my text, you may know; there is <hi>a walking after truth,</hi> and <hi>a walking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lyes;</hi> or which is all one, there is <hi>a walking after God,</hi> and <hi>a walking after Idols.</hi> We <hi>walke after truth,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> when from the bottome of our hearts, we thinke vpon, and do those things, which God hath prescribed vnto vs in the word of truth; when we liue a godly life, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world. On the other side, we <hi>walke after lyes,</hi> or <hi>after Idols,</hi> when we worship that which is not God; or when we worship the true God, but vpon a false founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, polluting and defiling his sacred worship, with the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1741:45"/> foolish imaginations and inventions of our owne braines. Thus did the ancient Iewes <hi>walke after Lyes;</hi> which is here laid vnto their charge: <hi>Their Lyes cause them to erre, after which their Fathers walked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto haue you heard the exposition of the text. Giue eare now I beseech you to such lessons as may from hence be taken for our further instruction, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our liues. The first lesson I take from these words, <hi>Their Lyes caused them to erre; their lyes,</hi> that is, their idolatrous and false worship of God, hath <hi>caused them to erre,</hi> hath deceiued them. The doctrine is:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When men decline or swerue from the prescript of Gods word, they are forthwith enwrapped and involued in deceit; and cannot but erre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thus explicate it. If we embrace not the truth of God, if we despise his holy Lawes, if we keepe not his commandements, we must of necessitie fall into supine and grosse lyes. For so God permitteth. Whosoeuer beleeue not the truth, but haue pleasure in vnrighteousnes; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer receiue not the loue of the truth, that they may be saued, to such shall God <hi>send strong delusion that they shall beleeue lyes,</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11. Now Almighty God to keepe his elect and beloued ones from such efficacie of errour, from such strong delusions; how oft doth he admonish them, that in no wise they depart from his holy word.<note n="q" place="margin">

               <p>A reason hereof I may giue you, out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.105. where the <hi>word of God</hi> is compared to a <hi>lampe,</hi> or a <hi>light: Thy word is a lampe vnto my feete, and a light vnto my path.</hi> You know the vse of a <hi>lampe,</hi> or <hi>light.</hi> It is to direct vs in the darke, that we erre not. Now what is this <hi>world,</hi> but <hi>a place of darknesse?</hi> Here the naturall man <hi>sitteth in darknes,</hi> Luk. 1.79. he <hi>walketh in darknes,</hi> Psal. 82.5. <hi>his eyes are blinded with darknes,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.11. <hi>his vnderstanding is darkned,</hi> Ephes. 4.18. <hi>he is subiect to the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> Coloss. 1.13. he <hi>hath fellowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darknes,</hi> Ephes. 5.11. he is <hi>euen darknes it selfe,</hi> Ephes. 5.8. How then <hi>can he chuse but erre,</hi> if he haue not this <hi>lampe,</hi> or <hi>light</hi> of God, <hi>the word of God,</hi> to direct him?</p>
               <p>It was not vnvsuall, with the Iewes, to seeke to them, who had<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Esai.</hi> 8.19.</note> familiar spirits, and to peeping and muttering wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards. To reclaime them from this error, the Prophet <hi>Esay cap.</hi> 8.20. calls them <hi>ad legem, &amp; ad testimonium,</hi> to the law and to the testimonie, that is, <hi>to the word of God.</hi> And why doth he so? He tells you why, in the words following: <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>they speake not according to this word, it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no light in them:</hi> What can be more plaine? Where <hi>the word of God</hi> is not, or directeth not, there is no <hi>light,</hi> there is nothing but <hi>darknesse,</hi> nothing but <hi>errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1741:46"/>
               <p>You haue enough for the confirmation and illustration of my doctrine, which was,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When men decline, or swerue from the prescript of Gods word, they are forthwith enwrapped and involued in deceit, and cannot but erre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it so beloued? If we leaue <hi>the word of God,</hi> are wee forthwith in <hi>errour?</hi> Let this be a strong motiue to vs, to giue more diligence to <hi>the word of God,</hi> then hitherto we haue done. Let vs as we are exhorted by <hi>S. Peter</hi> in his 2. <hi>Epist. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. Let vs <hi>take heed vnto it, as vnto a light, that shineth in a darke place, till the day dawne, and the day-starre arise in our hearts.</hi> Let vs not thinke any time mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spent, that we bestow vpon this <hi>word of God,</hi> either to <hi>heare</hi> it, or to <hi>read</hi> it, or to <hi>keepe</hi> it. Yong men, wherewithall will you clense your wayes, but by taking heed vnto <hi>your wayes</hi> according to the <hi>word of God,</hi> as you are aduised, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119.9. All men I know would be blessed; but then must they delight in the <hi>word of God,</hi> and make it their <hi>medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion day and night,</hi> as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.2. If we leaue <hi>the word of God,</hi> which is the <hi>lampe</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of God, then are we forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in <hi>darknes;</hi> we are in <hi>error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it so, beloued? Then secondly let vs bring and offer to our gracious God, the <hi>calues of our lips,</hi> the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiuing, for that it pleaseth him for our direction in this <hi>valley of darknes</hi> and <hi>shadow of death,</hi> to giue vs the <hi>light</hi> of his most precious word. He hath not dealt so with many nations of the earth. Many there are, that haue not the <hi>light</hi> of his <hi>word.</hi> And where this <hi>light</hi> is not, there can be nothing but <hi>darknes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it so, beloued? Then thirdly is the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> very iniurious to the people of God, to with-hold and keepe from them this <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>word of God.</hi> Is it not plaine, they do so, when they forbid the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be translated into any Vulgar tongue, and so seale them vp from the vnderstanding of the ignorant and vnlearned? They willingly send the <hi>Scriptures</hi> abroad in the <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> tongues: but what are the common
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1741:47"/> people of any Nation hereby benefited? Do they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> or <hi>Latin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Papist will answer; there is no necessitie that the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort should vnderstand those ancient &amp; sacred tongues. The<note n="f" place="margin">Ralford. Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie cap. <hi>56.</hi>

               <p>I grant, there is no necessitie, yea it cannot be, that the common people should vnderstand, the <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues: but I adde; it is therefore necessarie that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> should be translated into <hi>vulgar</hi> and <hi>knowne tongues,</hi> euen for the vnderstanding of the common people: as this day (through Gods goodnes) we haue them in our <hi>English</hi> tongue, not dismembred, and very much corrupted, as <hi>Radford</hi> would beare the world in hand; but more perfectly rendred, then euer was that old <hi>vulgar Latin edition,</hi> obtruded to the Christian world for <hi>Authenticall</hi> by the<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>Latimer,</hi> is altogether as vaine, and friuolous. The danger of hauing the <hi>Bible</hi> in our <hi>English tongue</hi> hee
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1741:48"/> prooued after this manner. The <hi>plowman</hi> hearing that in the Gospell by S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>

                  </note>
                  <hi>Latimers wish</hi> was, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> may be so long in our <hi>English tongue,</hi> till English men be so mad; the <hi>plowman, not to looke backe; the baker, not to leauen his bread;</hi> the <hi>simple man, to pluck out his owne eye.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This was not the practise of olde. Of old time, in the primitiue times of the Church, the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> had their free passage. All sorts of people might <hi>read them,</hi> might <hi>search into them,</hi> might <hi>iudge of them.</hi> The vnlearned, as the learned; the laitie, as the clergie; women, as men; base, as noble; yong, as old; all had their shares in <hi>reading,</hi> in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> in <hi>meditating,</hi> in <hi>practising</hi> the sacred doctrines contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> There can be no iust reason to the contrary.</p>
               <p>For as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his first <hi>Homilie</hi> vpon S. <hi>Mathew</hi> saith: <hi>The Scriptures are easie to the slaue, and to the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to the widdow, and to the childe, and to him, that may seeme to be very simple of vnderstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which purpose S. <hi>Austine Epi.</hi> 3. <hi>ad volusian:</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Almightie God in the Scriptures speaketh, as a familiar friend without dissimulation, vnto the hearts both of the learned, and also of the vnlearned.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1741:48"/>
               <p>The like S. <hi>Basil</hi> avoucheth vpon the 1. <hi>Psal. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is like an Apothecaries shop, full of medicines of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sorts, that euery man may there choose a conuenient remedie for his disease.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon this ground S. <hi>Chrysostome Hom.</hi> 2. <hi>in Iohan</hi> would perswade his auditors, not onely <hi>in the Church to bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the word of God,</hi> but that <hi>at home also, the husband with the wife, and the father with the childe, would talke together thereof; and would to and fro inquire, and giue their iudgments: and would to God,</hi> sayth he, <hi>they would once beginne this most approued, and most excellent custome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his fift Booke <hi>de curatione Graecarum affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> seemeth much to reioyce at the knowledge which the Christians generally had in the sacred Scriptures. <hi>Our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</hi> (saith he) <hi>is knowne not onely of them, who are the doctors of the Church, and Masters of the people, but also euen of Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Smiths, and Weauers, and all Artificers: of women too, not such onely as were learned, but also of labouring women, and Sewsters, and seruants, and hand-maides. Neither onely Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but Country folkes also doe very well vnderstand the same: Ditchers, deluers, Cowheards, Gardiners, can dispute of the Trinitie, and the creation of all things.</hi>

               <p>Thus was it of old, and why should it not be so now in our daies? The <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are the same now, that then they were. Now, as in the dayes of<note n="q" place="margin">Sermon. de Confessorib. sive Dispensat. p. <hi>610.</hi>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1741:49"/> safe from <hi>errour.</hi> But if we will not follow it; if we will <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,</hi> if we will <hi>swerue from it,</hi> we shall be suddainly <hi>involued, and inwrapped in deceit, and cannot choose but erre:</hi> This was my first doctrine. I can but touch the second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their lies caused them to erre, after which their Fathers walked.]</hi> You haue vnderstood by my precedent expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these words, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Iudah</hi> are here blamed, for adhering to the blind superstitions of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. The doctrine arising hence is this;
<q>In matters of Religion we are not tyed to follow our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This truth is plainely deriued from my text, for if we will make it our rule in Religion, <hi>to follow our forefathers; their lyes,</hi> that is, their blind superstitions, and idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, may deceiue vs, and cause vs to erre. Were not the elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> thus deceiued, and brought into errour? The twentie Chapter of the prophecie of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> makes it plaine, that they were so: there shall you finde it obiected to them; that <hi>they were polluted after the manner of their fathers, and committed whoredome after the abomination of their fathers,</hi> ver. 30. And to draw them from adhering to the ill courses of their fathers, the Lord himselfe is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>ver.</hi> 18. 19. thus to speake vnto them: <hi>Walke yee not in the statutes of your fathers, neither obserue their iudgements, nor defile yourselues with their Idoles. I am the Lord your God: Walke in my statutes, keepe my iudgements, and doe them.</hi> What will you more for the confirmation of my propoūded do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? You haue alreadie the warrant of Almightie God from heauen for it, that <hi>in matters of Religion we are not tyed to follow our forefathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is backed with another text, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Be not as your Fathers: your Fathers they heard me not, they hearkened not vnto me, saith the Lord. Be not</hi> you therefore <hi>as your fathers.</hi> Your <hi>fathers tempted me in the desert, Psal.</hi> 95.9. Will you also tempt me? <hi>Be not as your Fathers.</hi> Your <hi>Fathers were a stubborne and rebellious generation, Psal.</hi> 78.8. Will you also be <hi>stubborne,</hi> and <hi>rebellious? Be not as your Fathers.</hi> It is out
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1741:49"/> of doubt; Our <hi>fathers</hi> must not be followed in euill. Yea, in <hi>matters of Religion</hi> we are not bound to follow our <hi>Fathers.</hi> If our <hi>fathers</hi> in their religion were blinded with superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and worshipped God otherwise, then they were direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods <hi>holy word,</hi> we are not <hi>to follow them:</hi> yea, we are plainely charged, <hi>not to be as they were:</hi> Thus briefly of my Doctrine:

               <p>THree former Sermons haue caried me past the preface, and the three first parts of this prophecie against <hi>Iudah:</hi> the fourth, which is the <hi>Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or <hi>Denuntiation of the iudgements of the Lord</hi> against <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> remaineth to be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of this my present discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I will send a fire</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These words are no strangers to you. You haue met with them fiue times in the first Chapter, and once before in this. Their exposition, their diuision, the Doctrines issuing from them, the Vses and applications of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, haue diuers times from out this place sounded in your eares. Yet now, (the order, obserued by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in deliuering this prophecie, so requiring it) they are once more to be commended to your religious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>May it please you therefore to obserue with me three circumstances. <hi>Quis, Quomodo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Qui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Quis comminatur:</hi> Who it is, that threatneth to punish. It is the <hi>Lord.</hi> For, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, I will send.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quomodo puniet:</hi> How, and by what meanes hee will punish. The letter of my text is for <hi>fire. I will send a fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Qui puniendi:</hi> Who are to be punished: And they are the inhabitants of the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the

               <p>This <hi>fire,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> sendeth vpon <hi>Iudah,</hi> is not so much a <hi>fire</hi> properly taken, as a <hi>fire</hi> in a figuratiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.

               </p>
               <p>This commination began to be fulfilled in the dayes of <hi>Zedechias,</hi> King of <hi>Iudah.</hi> The historie is very memorable; and is briefly yet diligently described in the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. and in the 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 25. and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 39. <hi>&amp;</hi> 52.

               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> thus dead, and scattered, what became of their glorious cittie <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> The holy <hi>Temple</hi> there was burnt, their strong and high wals were throwne downe; all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie became wast and desolate, and so it remaines to this day. Certainly it is befallen <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> according to this commination in my text: <hi>I will send a fire vpon</hi> Iudah, <hi>and it shall deuoure the palaces of</hi> Ierusalem. Thus farre haue you the words of my text expounded. Now to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>You haue heard Gods iudgments against the kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the glorious Citie <hi>Ierusalem</hi> denounced in the same words, as his iudgements were against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites.</hi> The <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites,</hi> were aliens from the Common wealth of <hi>Israell,</hi> they were strangers from the couenant of promise; they had no hope, they were without God in the world. But these <hi>Iewes,</hi> these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitants of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were of the Common wealth of <hi>Israel:</hi> God made his couenant with them; they were not without hope; they were the people of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> was their God: yet because they sinned against the <hi>Lord,</hi> as the forenamed Gentiles did, the <hi>Lord</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to deale with them, as with the Gentiles; euen to <hi>send a fire vpon Iudah,</hi> which hath long since deuoured the palaces
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1741:54"/> of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The doctrine which from hence I commend vnto you, is;
<q>Whosoeuer doe imitate the Heathen in their impieties, they are in the Lords account no better then the Heathen, and shall be punished as the Heathen.</q>

               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Persons</hi> I meane, not the substance of man, or man himselfe, but his outward qualitie or condition; as <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, sex, parentage, wealth, pouertie, nobilitie, wisedome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and the like. According to these, God in iudgement <hi>respecteth</hi> no man. Whosoeuer he be, <hi>Iew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> male, or female, poore and rich, bond or free, learned, or vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that feareth God, and worketh righteousnesse, hee is <hi>accepted</hi> with God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.35. but let <hi>Iew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> male, or female, poore or rich, bond or free, the learned or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, worke wickednesse before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and he shalbe without partialitie punished, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.19.</p>
               <p>Such hath euer beene the practise of the <hi>Lord. Lazarus</hi> his pouerty did not hinder him from saluation, neither did the <hi>rich</hi> mans abundance free him from damnation. It was no impeachment to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that he was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> nor immunitie to <hi>Iudas,</hi> that he was a <hi>Iew; Saules</hi> throne could not shield him from the wrath of God, neither did <hi>Dauids</hi> sheepfolds avert from him the blessings of God; <hi>Esau</hi> was the elder brother, yet God hated him, <hi>Iacob</hi> was the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet God loued him. Neuer did any perish in <hi>obedience,</hi> neuer did any prosper in <hi>rebellion.</hi> Certainely <hi>God hath no respect of any mans person,</hi> for his outward estate, qualitie, or condition. God spared not the <hi>Angels</hi> for their excellencie, nor the <hi>old world</hi> for their multitude; nor <hi>Saul</hi> for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1741:55"/> nor <hi>Absolon</hi> for his beautie, nor the <hi>Iewes</hi> for their prerogatiue, nor <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for her goodly buildings. From this vnpartialitie of God in his workes of iustice, my propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition stands good,
<q>Whosoeuer doe imitate the Heathen in their impieties, are in the Lords account no better, then the Heathen, and shall be punished as the Heathen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Will you a reason hereof? It is because the Lord takes impietie for impietie wheresoeuer he finds it, and for such doth punish it. And he finds it euery where. For the eyes of the <hi>Lord</hi>

A <hi>Christian</hi> is he, who is a follower of Christ, who is holy, innocent, vndefiled, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted, in whose brest there is no wickednesse; who hurts no man, but helpeth all.

               </p>
               <p>Thus farre of my first doctrine. A second followeth.</p>
               <p>I take it from the condition of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> She had faire appellations. She was called the <hi>Virgin, and the daughter of Iudah.</hi> Lament. 1.15. The <hi>daughter of Sion.</hi> ver. 6. the cittie, that <hi>was great among the nations, and a Princes among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces.</hi> ver. 1. <hi>The holy Cittie.</hi> Mat. 4.5. <hi>The Cittie of the great King.</hi> Mat. 5.35. The <hi>Lord</hi> he chose it, he <hi>desired it for his habitation,</hi> he said of it: <hi>This is my rest for euer, here will I dwell, for I haue a delight therein,</hi> Psal. 132.14. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is rased from the foundation, shee is vtterly destroyed. It is befallen her according to this commination in my text, <hi>I will send a fire vpon</hi> Iudah, <hi>which shall deuoure the palaces of</hi> Ierusalem. My doctrine is;
<q>God will seuerely punish sinne, euen in his dearest children.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This S. <hi>Peter</hi> avoweth, 1. Epistle 4.17. saying: <hi>Iudgement must begin at the house of God,</hi> His meaning is, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and chastisement of sinnes beginneth with the Saints and seruants of God, in whom as it were in a house, or <hi>Temple</hi> God dwelleth. If they who are most familiar with vs, do sinne against vs, we fret and grow discontented. The most familiar with God are his faithfull ones, who fill the <hi>house of God,</hi> which is his <hi>Church.</hi> If these sinne against God, can God take it well? He cannot. He will punish euen his faithfull ones. So sayth S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Austine, Epist.</hi> 122. <hi>Ad victoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num; Propter peccata sua etiam sancti flagellantur,</hi> the verie Saints of God are scourged for their sinnes. You see my doctrine confirmed;
<q>God will seuerely punish sinne euen in his dearest children.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reason is giuen by S. <hi>Austine</hi> in his Booke of fiftie
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1741:57"/>
                  <hi>Homilies, Homil.</hi> 21. because <hi>Iustitia est, vt puniat peccatum,</hi> it is a part of Gods iustice to punish sinne, a part of his <hi>Actiue iustice;</hi> So doe the Schooles call the <hi>Iustice of God,</hi> by which he iudgeth and punisheth offenders. Of this <hi>Iustice of God</hi> it is said in our English Liturgie: <hi>It belongeth to God iustly to punish sinnes.</hi> Yea, so doth it belong to God, that God is not <hi>iust,</hi> vnlesse he <hi>punish sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vse of this doctrine is vrged to vs by S. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Epist. Chap. 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 17.18. If God will seuerely punish his owne children for their sinnes; If <hi>iudgement must begin at the house of God;</hi> what shall become of strange children, <hi>children of Belial? What shall be the end of them, that obey not the Gospell of God?</hi> And <hi>if the righteous scarcely be saued, where shall the vngodly and sinner appeare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpose is that of our blessed Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> Luk. 23.31. <hi>If they doe these things to a greene tree, what shall be done to the dry?</hi> It is, as if he had said more plainly thus; If God, my Father, suffer me, who am innocent and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, who am like a <hi>greene</hi> and a fruitfull <hi>tree,</hi> so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously to be afflicted, and to be hewen downe, as if I were a <hi>dry tree,</hi> how much more will he suffer you, who are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and rightly compared to <hi>dry</hi> and barren <hi>trees,</hi> to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and to be hewen downe? The like argument doth the <hi>Lord</hi> bring against <hi>Edom. Ierem.</hi> 49.12. <hi>Behold they whose iudgement, was not to drinke of the cup, haue assuredly drunken, and shalt thou altogether goe vnpunished? Thou shalt goe vnpunished, but thou shalt surely drinke of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What shall I more say? Let vs diligently weigh, what hath alreadie beene sayd. Lay we it to our soules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. We haue seene, that the <hi>infinite Iustice</hi> of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payeth <hi>vengeance for sinne,</hi> euen vpon the heads of his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest children. <hi>The inhabitants of</hi> Iudah, Gods inheritance, <hi>great Ierusalem,</hi> the cittie of God, the glorious temple there, the house of God, for <hi>sinnes pollution</hi> haue beene brought to destruction.</p>
               <p>Christ himselfe, the onely begotten sonne of God, the well-beloued sonne of God, he in whom alone God is well
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1741:57"/> pleased, because he<note n="q" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</note>

               <p>Thus sweete Sauiour hast thou suffered for our rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for our transgressions, for our iniquities: the <hi>chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was vpon thee,</hi> and <hi>with thy stripes we are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> It fell out happily for vs (beloued) that Christ, who <hi>knew no sinne,</hi> should be <hi>made sinne for vs,</hi> that we, who bore about with vs, a<note n="s" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thus saith the Lord] Iehovah.</hi> Now the thirteenth time is this great Name of God, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> offered to our deuoutest meditations. We met with it in the first chapter of this book nine times; and thrise before in this: and yet, by this name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> is not God knowne to vs. We know him by the name of a <hi>strong, omnipotent,</hi> and <hi>All-sufficient God,</hi> but by his Name, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> we know him not. <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob,</hi> by this Name knew him not: it is so recorded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. Nor can we by this Name know him. For this Name is a Name of <hi>Essence.</hi> It designeth God vnto vs, not by any effect of his, but by his <hi>Essence:</hi> and who euer knew the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of God? who was euer able to define it?</p>

                  </note> schoole-men say, there are three things whereof they can giue no definition: One is, that <hi>first matter,</hi> out of which all things were produced: The second is, <hi>Sinne,</hi> that hath destroyed all: The third is, <hi>God,</hi> who preserueth all. The first, which is the Philosophers <hi>Materia prima,</hi> they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1741:59"/> define not <hi>obsummam informitatem,</hi> because it is without all forme: The second, which is mans bane, <hi>Sinne,</hi> they define not <hi>obsummam deformitatem,</hi> for its exceeding deformitie: The third, euen <hi>God,</hi> the prime cause of all his creatures, they define not <hi>ob summam formositatem,</hi> for his transcendēt beautie. It pleaseth the Schoolmen sometimes thus to play with words. For the matter they are in the right.</p>

                  <hi>Simonides</hi> was asked of <hi>K. Hiero,</hi> what God is? He wisely for answere desired <hi>one dayes respite,</hi> after that <hi>two,</hi> then <hi>foure;</hi> still he <hi>doubled</hi> his number: at last; of his delay he gaue this for a reason: <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diutiùs considero, tanto mihi res videtur obscurior;</hi> the more I consider of this matter, the more obscure it seemeth vnto me. <hi>Cotta</hi> in<note n="i" place="margin">Ibid.</note>

               <p>And what is he not?

               <p>
                  <hi>Thus saith Iehouah]</hi> By this name <hi>Iehouah,</hi> we are taught three things.</p>
               <p>First, that God of himselfe, and through himselfe, hath alwayes beene, now is and euer shall be.

                  </gap>, <hi>He that is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we are taught by this name <hi>Iehouah,</hi> that the <hi>essence,</hi> or being of all things created is from God; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we liue, and moue, and haue our being;</hi> and that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him are all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are taught by this name <hi>Iehouah,</hi> that God doth giue <hi>Esse reale,</hi> a reall being to his promises &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: that he is <hi>veracissimus</hi> and <hi>constantissimus,</hi> most true and most constant, in doing whatsoeuer he hath promised or threatned.</p>
               <p>This consideration of this great Name, <hi>Iehouah,</hi> may yeeld much comfort to all the Elect of God, and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones. Though they seeme to<note n="d" place="margin">

For God who hath promised, hee is the <hi>Lord,</hi> he is <hi>Iehouah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe this consideration of this great name <hi>Iehouah,</hi> may strike a terror into the hearts of the reprobate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers. They<note n="f" place="margin">

For God, who hath threatned hee is the <hi>Lord,</hi> hee is <hi>Iehouah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

By this which hath this time beene spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, you see whence this prophesie against <hi>Israel</hi> hath its authority.

                  <hi>Three and foure</hi> make seuen. It seemeth then, that <hi>Israel</hi> transgressed against God seuen times. Seuen times! It is plaine by Scripture, that they transgressed <hi>Saepiùs ac saepiùs,</hi> as <hi>Mercerus</hi> speaketh, many a time &amp; oft: yea, from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of their Kingdome vnder <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> sonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> their first King, vnto <hi>Hoshea,</hi> sonne of <hi>Elah,</hi> their last King, they did nothing but transgresse against the Lord their God, what by <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and what by other <hi>wickednesses.</hi> Heere then, by <hi>three and foure,</hi> which make <hi>seuen,</hi> we are to vnderstand <hi>many.</hi>

In <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26.18. to the rebellious and disobedient, thus saith the Lord: <hi>If ye will not yet, for all this, hearken vnto me, then I will punish you seuen times more for your sinnes.</hi> Seuen times more, that is, many times more, will I punish you. <hi>Hannah</hi> in her song, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5. hath this straine; <hi>The barren hath borne seuen children.</hi> By seuen there, you are to vnderstand many: Shee that was barren, hath borne many children. <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.164. sayth; <hi>Seuen times a day doe I praise thee.</hi> Seuen times, that is, many times; as if had sayd, <hi>Semper laus eius in ore meo,</hi> All the day long am I in the praises of my God. <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Prou.</hi> 26, 25. aduiseth vs not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the gracious words of an enemy, because, saith hee, <hi>there are in his heart seuen abominations.</hi> Seuen abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is, many abominations, many sly purposes lie hidden in the heart of an enemy. What neede more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples? By these few the phrase in my text is plaine. The <hi>seuen</hi> transgressions of Israel (for <hi>three &amp; foure</hi> are <hi>seuen</hi>) the <hi>seuen</hi> transgressions of Israel, are the <hi>many</hi> transgressions of Israel. In this phrase then doth the <hi>Lord</hi> obiect vnto Israel
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1741:62"/>
                  <hi>innumera peccata,</hi> the multitude of their sinnes. For which he is vnwilling any longer to forbeare them: whereupon followeth his protestation against them, <hi>I will not turne away the punishment thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For three transgressions of Israel, and for foure, I will not turne away the punishment thereof]</hi> The meaning is; if once, if twice, yea, if a third time only the Israelites had offended mee with the greeuousnesse of their transgressions, I could haue tolerated them, and would not haue cast them from out my sight: but now; whereas a fourth time, <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now from these two first parts of this prophesie, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>accusation</hi> of Israel for sinne, and the Lords <hi>protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> against them for the same, ariseth this lesson, <q>God is euer in open hostility with sinners.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>sinner</hi> ouer-valuing the <hi>vanities</hi> wherein his <hi>delight</hi> is placed, first <hi>neglecteth God,</hi> then <hi>hateth</hi> him. Thus affected, he would, if possible, disarme God of his authority, pull his power from him, and cast him out of his state. Hee could wish, there were no immortality of the Soule, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be made of our actions, no reward, no reuenge, no Iudge to punish. So willing is hee to bathe himselfe in the imaginary contentment and pleasures of <hi>sinne.</hi> I can put no great difference between this <hi>sinner</hi> and an <hi>Atheist.</hi> The <hi>Atheist</hi> thinketh, <hi>there is no God;</hi> this <hi>sinner</hi> wisheth, <hi>there were no God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>God,</hi> who feeleth the pulse of this sinners heart, and searcheth his inmost thoughts, &amp; seeth his traytorous affection, can he be at peace with him? King <hi>Ioram</hi> sayd to <hi>Iehu,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Is it peace</hi> Iehu? Iehu <hi>answered, what
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1741:62"/> peace, so long as the whoredomes of thy mother</hi> Iezabel, <hi>and her witch-crafts are so many?</hi> This <hi>sinner</hi> happily will looke to be <hi>at peace</hi> with God: but he is soone answered, <hi>What hast thou to doe with peace?</hi> What peace with God doest thou looke for, so long as thou castest away his feare, and liest wallowing in thy <hi>sinnes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must grant it: <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>God of peace;</hi> the Scripture saith it more then once, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.33, and chap. 16.20. and in<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.23. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.20.</note> other places. But what is this to the <hi>sinner?</hi> Nothing at all. For the same Scripture will assure him, <hi>there is no peace to him; Esai</hi> 48.22. and 57.12. To the sinner the <hi>Lord</hi> will shew himselfe, <hi>quasi bellator fortis,</hi> as hee is called, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 20.11. hee will shew himselfe as a <hi>stout warriour.</hi> And for such he is described, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41. There thus saith the <hi>Lord</hi> concerning sinners: <hi>If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on iudgement, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrowes drunk with their blood, and my sword shall deuoure their flesh?</hi> To like purpose is that, which we read of Gods dealing with sinners, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.12. <hi>He whets his sword, he bends his bow, and makes it ready, hee prepareth for them the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death, he ordaineth his arrowes against them.</hi> So haue you my doctrine established, <q>God is euer in open hostility with sinners.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is God euer <hi>in open hostility with sinners?</hi> Consider this all yee that <hi>feare God;</hi> remember it all ye, that beare the image of the Almighty. The sinner, that is ouertaken with <hi>three transgressions,</hi> and with <hi>foure,</hi> that lieth in his sinnes, and walloweth in his iniquities, his case is fearefull, his estate lamentable. God proclaimeth against him <hi>open warre,</hi> most certaine destruction, and <hi>will not turne away his punishments</hi> from him. Let it (Beloued) rouze vs vp from that <hi>sleepe of sinne,</hi> wherein we haue too long rested. All the good gifts, and benefits of God, which God hath bestowed vpon vs for our good, we haue abused to <hi>sinne.</hi> God hath giuen vs <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> to meditate vpon his holy lawes, but our <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> we haue peruerted to the transgression of his holy
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1741:63"/> Lawes. God hath giuen vs <hi>the will</hi> to loue him aboue all things, and our neighbours, as our selues; but we haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted <hi>our will</hi> to the contempt of God, and the hate of our neighbours. God hath giuen vs <hi>the tongue</hi> to powre forth his praises, but <hi>our tongues</hi> we haue defiled with impure oathes, and ougly blasphemies. God hath giuen vs <hi>hands</hi> for instruments to feed the poore, and to defend them, but the strength of <hi>our hands</hi> we haue wasted in crueltie and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine. In a word, God hath giuen vs <hi>our soules,</hi> and <hi>our bodies,</hi> all the <hi>faculties</hi> of the one, all the <hi>members</hi> of the other, all, to doe him seruice; but we haue imployed all to his dishonor.</p>
               <p>Dearely beloued, what shall we doe? The best aduise I can giue, is that, which Christ giueth his Spouse in the Canticles, chap. 6.13. <hi>Returne, returne,</hi> O Shulamite; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, returne, that we may behold thee.</hi> I thus paraphrase it: <hi>Returne,</hi> O my Spouse, daughter of Ierusalem <hi>returne, returne</hi> to me, <hi>returne</hi> to thy selfe, <hi>returne</hi> to thy former feeling of my Grace, <hi>returne,</hi> that both my selfe and all the companie of Angels, may see thee, and reioyce in thee.</p>
               <p>This Spouse of Christ is the mother of vs all, <hi>the holy Catholique Church,</hi> in whose bosome we are nourished. Take we then the aduise giuen vnto her, for an aduise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our selues. <hi>Returne</hi> we from our euill wayes, <hi>returne</hi> we from our <hi>three and foure transgressions, returne</hi> we from all our sinnes, <hi>returne</hi> we to the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> that both he and all the companie of Angels may see vs, and reioyce in vs. <hi>Mutet vitam, qui vult accipere vitam,</hi> saith <hi>S. Augustine Serm.</hi> 1. <hi>de tempore:</hi> if wee will enioy the <hi>blessed life</hi> of Heauen, we must change <hi>our wicked life</hi> on earth.

               <p>Thus far of the <hi>generall accusation of Israel,</hi> and the <hi>Lords protestation against them;</hi> in those words, <hi>For three transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Israel, and for foure, I will not turne away the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</hi> It followeth,
<q>Because they sold the righteous for siluer, and the poore for a paire of shoes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here beginneth the rehersall of those grieuous sinnes, which made a separation betweene God and Israel. In these words two sinnes are specified; <hi>Crueltie,</hi> and <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes.</hi> Their <hi>Cruelty</hi> I note in <hi>selling</hi> of the <hi>righteous,</hi> and the <hi>poore:</hi> their <hi>Couetousnes,</hi> in as much as they did it for <hi>siluer,</hi> and for <hi>a paire of shoes.</hi> I take the words in their order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They sold the righteous for siluer]</hi> A man may be said to be <hi>righteous,</hi> either by <hi>imputation,</hi> or by <hi>vertue,</hi> or by <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,</hi> or by <hi>course of law.</hi> The <hi>righteous</hi> man by <hi>imputation</hi> is he, whom <hi>Habakkuk</hi> speaketh of, chap. 2.4. <hi>The iust shall liue by his faith.</hi> There the <hi>iust</hi> or <hi>righteous</hi> man is he, to whom the <hi>Lord imputeth not his sinnes,</hi> which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted. The <hi>righteous</hi> man by <hi>vertue</hi> is he, whom <hi>Dauid</hi>-speaketh of, Psal. 11.3. <hi>If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous doe?</hi> There the <hi>righteous</hi> man is he, whom we call <hi>virum bonum,</hi> a good man. The <hi>righteous</hi> man by <hi>comparison</hi> is he, whom <hi>Habakkuk</hi> speaketh of, chap. 1. 13. <hi>Wherefore holdest thou thy tongue, when the wicked deuoureth the man, that is more righteous, then he.</hi> There the <hi>righteous</hi> man is he, that is <hi>the lesse wicked:</hi> the <hi>Iewes,</hi> though wicked, are yet called <hi>righteous</hi> in <hi>comparison</hi> of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who were <hi>more wicked.</hi> The <hi>righteous</hi> man by <hi>course of law</hi> is he, whom <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh of, chap. 5. 23. <hi>Wo vnto them which iustifie the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousnesse of the righteous from him.</hi> There the <hi>righteous</hi> is he, that hath a <hi>righteous</hi> cause: and this is the <hi>righteous</hi> man in my text; whom the Israelites are said to <hi>haue sold for siluer.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>They sold the righteous for siluer] For siluer,</hi> that is, for money. The like phrase we haue in <hi>Micah, chap.</hi> 3.11. where it is said of the Prophets of Israel, <hi>they diuine for sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> that is, they <hi>diuine</hi> only for monyes sake. For monyes sake to condemne the righteous, it is <hi>ingens piaculum;</hi> it is a very heynous offence, not to be purged without deepe satisfaction. And therefore in the forecited place of <hi>Esai,</hi> chap. 5.23. a <hi>woe</hi> is denounced to such offenders. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith they are <hi>an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prou. 17.15. <hi>He that iustifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the iust: euen they both are abomination to the Lord.</hi> I may not now enlarge my notes.</p>
               <p>You vnderstand, what it is, <hi>to sell the righteous for siluer</hi> It is, to <hi>to take away the righteousnes of the righteous from him;</hi> and that is, to be hired by <hi>money, bribes,</hi> or <hi>rewards,</hi> to giue sentence against the man, whose cause is <hi>iust,</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They sold the righteous for siluer, and the poore for a paire of shoes]</hi> By the <hi>poore</hi> here we may vnderstand the cause of the poore: as in <hi>Amos</hi> 5.12. <hi>They afflict the iust, they take a bribe, and they turne aside the poore in the gate. They turne aside the poore in the gate]</hi> that is, they turne the <hi>poore man</hi> out of his right: they ouerthrow the <hi>poore mans cause</hi> in iudgement.</p>
               <p>Againe, by the <hi>poore</hi> here, we may vnderstand the man, that is in miserie; the man, that is vnworthily afflicted; the man, that is tossed, turmoiled, grieuously disquieted by some mighty wicked man.</p>
               <p>This <hi>poore man,</hi> the Israelites did sell, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They sold the poore for a paire of shoes]</hi> If they <hi>sold,</hi> some <hi>bought.</hi> Such <hi>buyers</hi> we finde, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.8. They tooke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1741:64"/> to buy <hi>the needie for siluer,</hi> and <hi>the poore for a paire of shoes.</hi> There they are <hi>bought,</hi> here they are <hi>sold:</hi> and all for <hi>a paire of shoes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For a paire of shoes]</hi> It is a prouerbiall speech; a speech fit to be vsed, if we would signifie a thing to be litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, of small estimation, of vile price. The like prouerbiall speech we haue, <hi>Prou.</hi> 28.21. There it is said of the man, that respecteth persons, that he will transgresse <hi>for a peece of bread. For a peece of bread,</hi> that is, for the vilest gift, for the basest commoditie. In which sence <hi>Cato</hi> said once to <hi>Coelius: frusto panis conduci potest, vel vt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat, vel vt loquatur:</hi> A man may <hi>hire</hi> him with <hi>a peece of bread,</hi> either to speake, or to hold his peace.</p>
               <p>We now vnderstand what our Prophet meaneth in these words; <hi>They sold the righteous for siluer, and the poore for a paire of shoes. They]</hi> The Israelites, the<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>heads</hi> of Israel, the Iudges of Israel; <hi>they sold]</hi> they circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they beguiled, they betrayed <hi>the righteous]</hi> him, whose cause was righteous, and iust: <hi>they sold the righteous for sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer]</hi> for money, for a bribe, for a reward: and they sold <hi>the poore]</hi> the needy man, the man afflicted, or his honest cause, <hi>for a paire of shoes]</hi> for a morsell of bread, for any base commoditie, for a trifle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They sold the righteous for siluer, and the poore for a paire of shoes]</hi> Here the Iudges of Israel are taxed for <hi>Crueltie,</hi> and <hi>Couetousnesse:</hi> for <hi>Cruelty,</hi> because they <hi>sold the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the poore:</hi> for <hi>Couetousnes,</hi> because they sold them <hi>for siluer,</hi> and <hi>for a paire of shoes.</hi> The lesson which we may take from hence, is this,
<q>Cruelty and Couetousnes in Iudges and Magistrates, are two of the sinnes, for which God bringeth States to ruine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You see it plaine in my text. God would not turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his punishments from Israel, because of the <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Couetousnes</hi> in <hi>the Iudges of Israel.</hi> These sins are most eminent in <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> but are reproveable in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1741:65"/>
                  <hi>all sorts</hi> of men. The <hi>Cruell</hi> and the <hi>Couetous,</hi> be they of whatsoeuer rancke in a Common wealth, they are very burdensome to God himselfe. God himselfe in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vers. 13. cryes out against them: <hi>Behold I am pressed vnder you as a cart is pressed, that is full of sheaues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time will not suffer me to inlarge my meditations vpon the discouerie of these two sinnes; <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes.</hi> I shall haue occasion to meete with them againe in the beginning of the next verse; where they are ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and may hope for the benefit of your new attention.</p>
               <p>For the present, let vs be admonished, that we suffer not our selues to be ouercome of these or any other sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinne!</hi> It produceth very sad and dolefull effects. It blindeth our vnderstanding, while it taketh from vs the supernaturall light of diuine grace; it staineth and defileth our consciences, with its filthinesse; it accuseth vs before the Lord of grieuous iniuries done against his Maiestie: it impouerisheth vs, when it spoiles vs of all spirituall good; it dishonoreth vs, when it diffameth vs in the sight of the Angels, and the whole Court of Heauen; it holdeth vs captiue, and depriueth vs of all liberty of well-doing; it bindeth vs with the chaines of euill custome; and brings vs within the danger of falling daily from bad to worse; <hi>vulnerat nos in bonis naturalibus, occidit in gratuitis,</hi> saith <hi>Cornelius Mussus B. of Bitonto:</hi> it woundeth vs in all the good faculties of our nature, and slayeth vs in the free graces, wherewith God hath beautified our soules.</p>
               <p>You see (dearely beloued in the Lord) you see what a tyrant <hi>Sinne</hi> is. It stoppeth vp the fountaines of Grace, and hindereth the streames of heauenly comfort from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to vs. Yet; yet our life is nothing, but a <hi>trade of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> In vs, in our flesh, there dwelleth no good.

               </p>
               <p>What remaineth, but that we powre forth our prayers
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1741:65"/> to Almightie God, that he will be pleased to giue vs true <hi>repentance</hi> for the wickednes of our fore-passed liues, and in his good time to loose vs from this bodie of sinne, and to couple vs to himselfe in Heauen: where we may with the whole multitude of Saints, sing vnto him an Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiah: <hi>Blessing, saluation, honor, glory, and power be vnto him that fitteth on the throne, and to the Lambe</hi> for euer and euer.

               <p>OF those grieuous sinnes, with which the people of Israel are in this Chapter charged, two were touched in the former verse: their <hi>Crueltie,</hi> and their <hi>Couetousnesse. They sold the righteous</hi> and <hi>the poore,</hi> this was <hi>Crueltie:</hi> they sold them <hi>for siluer,</hi> and <hi>for a paire of shoes;</hi> this was <hi>Couetousnesse.</hi> Now in the beginning of this 7. verse are those two sinnes amplified: Their <hi>Couetousnesse</hi> thus: They were neuer satisfied, till they had cast downe the <hi>righteous</hi> and the <hi>poore</hi> to the <hi>dust of the earth:</hi> Their <hi>Crueltie</hi> thus: They were not content thus to haue exhausted and spoyled them, but did also conspire against, and gape after, their liues; for <hi>They par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the dust of the earth on the head of the poore.</hi> Before we take a further view of these sinnes, <hi>Crueltie</hi> and <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse;</hi> let vs fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>The dust of the earth on the head of the poore]</hi> The casting of <hi>dust</hi> or <hi>earth vpon the head,</hi> was of old and long time a ceremonie, whereby men in sad and dolefull plight were wont to expresse their griefe. Mention is made of it, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7.6. There it is said, that <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>the elders of Israel,</hi> to testifie their griefe for the ouerthrow giuen them by the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> rent their clothes, fell to the earth vpon their faces, and <hi>put dust vpon their heads.

But this is by the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alleaged, sufficiently declared vnto you. If to this ceremonie of besmering the <hi>head</hi> with <hi>earth, dust,</hi> or <hi>ashes,</hi> our Prophet here alludeth, then are the rulers of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the rich among them here taxed for their <hi>hard-heartednesse</hi> towards the <hi>poore,</hi> for their <hi>couetousnes</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> whereby they oppressed the poore; to this sense:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They pant after the dust of the earth, on the head of the poore] They]</hi> the rulers of Israel, and the rich men there, <hi>They pant after the dust of the earth]</hi> they greedily desire to see the dust of the earth sprinckled, <hi>on the head of the poore]</hi> they make it their pleasure, to giue the honest <hi>poore man,</hi> iust cause of griefe, and mourning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They pant after the dust of the earth]</hi> The <hi>dust;</hi> sometime it betokeneth a low and base estate, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Hannah</hi> in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1741:67"/> her song of thankfulnes, praising the Lord for his benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence towards the humble &amp; despised, saith, <hi>He raiseth the</hi> poore <hi>out of the</hi> dust, <hi>and lifteth vp the</hi> begger <hi>from the</hi> dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill. So, in so many words saith the Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> 113.7. <hi>He raiseth vp the</hi> poore <hi>out of the</hi> dust, <hi>and lifteth vp the</hi> begger <hi>from the</hi> dunghill. In both places the latter phrase is a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, or exposition of the former. <hi>The Lord raiseth vp the poore out of the dust,</hi> that is, <hi>the Lord lifteth vp the begger from the dunghill.</hi> The meaning is: The Lord through his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, and of his goodnes, exalteth the <hi>poore</hi> and abiect amongst men from their vile &amp; contemptible estate to some degree of honour. Hitherto may we adde that of <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Let him lay mine honor in the</hi> dust. <hi>Let him lay mine honor in the</hi> dust! Whats that? <hi>If</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid, I haue rewarded euill to him, that was at peace with me, let the enemie lay mine honor in the dust;</hi> that is, let mine honor be so put out, that there may be no more remembrance of it in the posteritie to come; let me euer be held for a base, vile, and contemptible wretch. If to this signification of <hi>Dust,</hi> our Prophet here alludeth; then are the rulers of Israel and the rich among them, here censured, for their cruell and vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable desire to <hi>grind the faces of the poore.</hi> Thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poore]</hi> That is, though the poore doe already sit vpon <hi>the dust of the earth,</hi> and are thereby in the eyes of the world, <hi>base, vile,</hi> and <hi>contemptible,</hi> yet do the <hi>rulers of Israel,</hi> and the <hi>rich</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, still <hi>pant after the dust of the earth vpon their heads,</hi> their delight is to behold them euer wallowing in the <hi>dust of the earth,</hi> to see them yet more <hi>base,</hi> more <hi>vile,</hi> more <hi>contemptible.</hi> Yea, they can bee contented that the <hi>dust,</hi> whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.15.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1741:68"/> and Gouernors of <hi>Israel,</hi> the rich of <hi>Israel,</hi> for their <hi>cruelty,</hi> their <hi>couetousnes,</hi> and their <hi>oppression</hi> of the poore of <hi>Israel,</hi> and they yeeld vnto vs this lesson.</p>
               <q>God pleadeth the cause of the poore against the cruell, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, and oppressors.</q>
               <p>By the <hi>poore</hi> in this proposition, I vnderstand all, that be in any need, necessitie or want; <hi>widdowes</hi> also &amp; <hi>father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse children,</hi> that haue lost their head; <hi>strangers</hi> likewise and <hi>exiles</hi> out of their country for religion, and good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. All these if they behaue themselues meekly, and seeke to liue peaceably with all men, and put themselues wholy into the hands of God, God receiueth into his protection, and pleadeth their cause.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>strangers</hi> the commandement is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppresse him.</hi> It is repeated, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.33. <hi>If a stranger s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, God pleadeth the cause of the <hi>widowes</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse children.</hi> The commandement concerning them is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.22. <hi>Yee shall not afflict any widow or fatherlesse childe.</hi> It is repeated, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Oppresse not the widow, nor the fatherlesse.</hi> Such is the commandment. Do men regard it? Doe they not rather adde affliction to the afflicted <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse,</hi> and <hi>widow?</hi> Doe they not oppresse, wrong, vexe, and grieue them? If they doe so, <hi>God</hi> is ready to right their cause, and to lay vengeance vpon their oppressors. For so much <hi>God</hi> vndertaketh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.23. <hi>If you afflict the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1741:68"/> or fatherlesse childe, in any wise, and they cry at all vnto me, I will surely heare their cry, my wrath shall waxe hot, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wiues shall be widowes, and your children fatherlesse.</hi> This protection ouer the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse</hi> and <hi>widowes</hi> is also ascribed vnto the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10 18. The Lord doth <hi>execute the iudgement of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and widow.</hi> It is very comfortably deliuered, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.5. <hi>God in his holy habitation is a father of the fatherlesse, and a iudge of the widowes.</hi> You see God pleadeth the cause of the <hi>widowes</hi> and the <hi>fatherlesse.</hi>

               <p>So also he pleadeth the cause of the <hi>poore,</hi> whatsoeuer he be.

               <p>Secondly: He pleadeth against the <hi>Couetous.</hi> Against the men of <hi>Iudah, Esai.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Yee haue eaten vp the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; the spoyle of the poore is in your houses.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly: He pleadeth against the <hi>Oppressors.</hi> Against the heads of Israel, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.3. <hi>Ye eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them;</hi> yee <hi>breake their bones, and chop them in pieces as for the pot, &amp; as flesh within the cauldron.</hi> Thus far of the doctrine.</p>

               <p>This metaphoricall signification of a <hi>way</hi> we meet with, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.20. There <hi>Moses</hi> is counselled by <hi>Iethro,</hi> to shew his people <hi>the way wherein they were to walke.</hi> We meet with it also in the Booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 17.9. There <hi>Iob</hi> sayth, the <hi>righteous shall hold on his way.</hi> We meete with it in many other places of holy writ, which I must now let passe; in all which, as in this place, the <hi>way</hi> betokeneth, the <hi>cause</hi> of a man, his <hi>right,</hi> his <hi>busines,</hi> his <hi>trade,</hi> or <hi>course of life.</hi> After this <hi>figuratiue</hi> signification some doe thus expound these words: <hi>They turne aside the way of the meeke;</hi> or, <hi>They peruert the way of the poore:</hi> that is, the <hi>Israelites</hi> their rulers, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, the rich among them, doe take in ill part what so euer the <hi>poore</hi> say, or doe. All their words, all their deeds
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1741:72"/> are found fault with. Some malicious inuention, or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, is euer at hand to lay the blame vpon them. This I take to be the fittest exposition for this place.</p>
               <p>Here then we haue the fourth sinne wherewith the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> are here charged. It is <hi>Caluninia;</hi> their <hi>false accusing of the poore,</hi> a sinne that euermore attendeth vpon <hi>Oppression.</hi> For the <hi>cruell,</hi> and <hi>couetous</hi> wretch, who is perswaded that his greatnesse chiefly consisteth in the <hi>oppression of the poore,</hi> will be sure so to prouide, to <hi>keepe the poore vnder,</hi> that they shall neuer be able to reuenge the wrongs done vnto them. Let the <hi>poore man</hi> slip but vnaduisedly or ignorantly, the <hi>lawes</hi> must by and by take hold on him: whereas the <hi>Rich man,</hi> the <hi>lawes</hi> are but as <hi>Cobwebs:</hi> he breakes throw them all. Hence is that common saying: the <hi>poore man doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well; the rich man nothing ill.</hi> Yea let the <hi>poore man</hi> doe all things well, yet will some <hi>rich calumniator</hi> euer be ready, to giue an ill construction of his <hi>best wayes;</hi> or, as the phrase in my text is, <hi>to turne aside the way of the meeke,</hi> or, <hi>to peruert the way of the poore.</hi> The lesson which we are to take from hence for our instruction is this;
<q>The poore man, which vseth any honest trade or course of life, is not to be turned out of his way: his words and actions are not to be mis-interpreted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reason of this doctrine is plaine in the sixth verse of this Chapter: The Lord <hi>will not turne away his punishments</hi> from the offenders in this kind; from such, <hi>as turne aside or peruert, the way of the meeke,</hi> and the <hi>poore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vse of this doctrine concerneth all those, whom God hath blessed with the wealth of this world. It is their dutie not to be carelesse of the <hi>poore,</hi> not to grieue them, not to hinder them in their honest courses, not <hi>to turne them aside</hi> out of their <hi>lawfull wayes.</hi> You that haue wherewith to maintaine your selues abundantly, you may not exempt your selues from doing seruice vnto God with your abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Yea you must straine your selues to the vttermost of your powers to relieue and succour such as are in scarcitie, and in want. This is a sacrifice that God requireth at your
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1741:72"/> hands. Offer it willingly, and you shall haue a reward. Your reward it shall not be a corruptible Crowne. It shall be a Crowne of eternitie. It shall be the possession of Heauen it selfe. The poore shall carry you thither.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1741:74"/> that is <hi>affianced,</hi> or betrothed <hi>to either,</hi> the <hi>sonne,</hi> or the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Of like minde is <hi>Arias Montanus.</hi> By this <hi>maide</hi> (saith he) we vnderstand <hi>non meretricem,</hi> not a common strumpet, one that makes gaine by the prostitution and abuse of her bodie; <hi>sed viro sponsam,</hi> but one that is betrothed to a man, <hi>aut certè nubilem,</hi> or at lest, one that is marriageable and is in her fathers house appointed for wedlocke. Some are of opinion, that by this <hi>maide,</hi> you may vnderstand, any <hi>maide;</hi> the daughter of any other man, to whom yet this <hi>man and his father</hi> vse to resort to satisfie their lusts.</p>
               <p>Now, if we will collect, as <hi>Montanus</hi> doth, the <hi>Father</hi> knew his owne <hi>daughter,</hi> his <hi>sonne</hi> knew the <hi>same,</hi> though she were to him, <hi>his sister:</hi> or the <hi>father</hi> knew his <hi>sonnes wife,</hi> his <hi>daughter in law:</hi> or the <hi>sonne</hi> knew his <hi>fathers wife,</hi> his <hi>mother in law:</hi> or both, <hi>the father and the sonne</hi> were naught with some other mans <hi>daughter:</hi> or all these wickednesses were in that corrupt state of <hi>Israell</hi> vsually acted. Of that state we may say with <hi>Brentius: Qualis pater, talis filius: pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fornicatur, filius scortatar, pater adulterium committit, fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us incestum; pater libidinem exercet prohibitam, filius turpem sequitur luxum.</hi> It is a <hi>fathers</hi> part, by his example of chast liuing, to invite his <hi>sonne</hi> to chastitie.

               <p>
                  <hi>To profane my holy Name.]</hi> What? Did this <hi>man and his father goe in vnto the same maide,</hi> with a minde <hi>to prophane</hi> Gods <hi>holy Name?</hi> was this their <hi>end?</hi> No doubtlesse, it was not their <hi>end.</hi> Their <hi>end</hi> was to enioy their carnall pleasures. And yet its here expressely said; they did it, <hi>to profane</hi> Gods <hi>holy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the remoouing of this scruple, that old Canon of an
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1741:75"/> auncient<note n="e" place="margin">Chrysostom.</note> Father, will serue. <hi>It is proper to the Scripture, to put that for a cause, which indeed belongeth to the event. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera</hi> thus explicats it: It is the manner of the <hi>Scripture</hi> sometime so to speake as if it considered onely, what a man doth, and not at all, with what mind he doth it: as if it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered what men doe vulgarly and vsually collect and iudge of any action by the event therof. For the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> many times speaketh as the custome of the common people is.</p>
               <p>This rule the <hi>Iesuite</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 654.</note>
                  <hi>Pererius</hi> in his Comment vpon <hi>Genes.</hi> chap. 43.6. thus plainely deliuereth. <hi>When vpon the deed of any one, any thing falleth out besides the purpose and will of the doer, it is commonly beleeued, and said to be done, as if the doer had of purpose willed it.</hi> Will you haue this rule made plaine by examples? Then thus. A man <hi>sinneth.</hi> His <hi>sinne</hi> draweth vpon him the <hi>losse</hi> &amp; <hi>destruction</hi> of his owne soule. Now he that <hi>sinneth</hi> doth not intend any such matter; hee intends not the <hi>losse,</hi> or <hi>destruction</hi> of his owne soule. Yet because he doth that, from whence followeth, the <hi>losse</hi> and <hi>destruction</hi> of his soule, he is said to will and seeke the perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne soule.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Canon</hi> rightly vnderstood, much helpeth for the explanation of diuers Scripture places. In<note n="g" place="margin">Hebr. Psal. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.6. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>vulgar Latin,</hi> we read, <hi>Qui diligit iniquitatem, odit aniniam suam;</hi> he that loueth <hi>iniquitie,</hi> hateth his owne soule. Did euer man <hi>hate his owne soule?</hi> We may not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it. Yet because he that <hi>loueth iniquitie,</hi> liueth for the most part as if he little cared for his soules health, it is there absolutely said: <hi>Hee that loueth iniquitie, hateth his owne soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Genes.</hi> 43.6. the vulgar Interpreter makes <hi>Israel</hi> thus to speake to <hi>Iudah,</hi> and other his sonnes, <hi>In meam hoc feci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis miseriam, vt indicaretis ei, &amp; alium vos habere fratrem;</hi> you haue done it to my miserie, that ye told the man, that you had another brother. Its true: <hi>Iacobs</hi> ten sonnes, when they were in <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy corne, told <hi>Ioseph</hi> (whom then they knew not to be <hi>Ioseph</hi>) that their <hi>yongest brother was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:1741:75"/> But did they doe it with a mind to bring misery vpon their aged father <hi>Iacob: Iacob</hi> himselfe could not thinke so, and the storie cleares them from that imputation. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by that their deed, miserie might haue fallen vpon their father <hi>Iacob, Iacob</hi> saith vnto them after a vulgar cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of speech, <hi>In meam hoc fecistis miseriam,</hi> you haue done this to make me miserable.</p>
               <p>In 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.16. the good woman of <hi>Shunem,</hi> that was by <hi>Elisha</hi> promised a sonne, notwithstanding her selfe was by nature barren, and her husband also old, said vnto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha: Nay my Lord, thou man of God, doe not lie vnto thine handmaide. Doe not lie!</hi> What! <hi>Elisha</hi> a Prophet, a man of God, could he, or would he <hi>lye?</hi> No; it beseemed him not. Yet because he promised, what was not in mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to performe, (a sonne to a woman that was naturally barren, and her husband also old) some might thinke, that he went about to deceiue the woman. The woman there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the common kinde of speech, saith vnto him; <hi>Nay my Lord, thou man of God, doe not lye vnto thine hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other like instances I might alledge for the further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>rule</hi> which euen now I proposed, But I need not. The kind of speech is familiar in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish tongue. If you see a <hi>sicke man</hi> intemperate, or refusing to follow the aduise of his learned <hi>Physitian,</hi> you wil straight way say, <hi>this man seekes his owne death; hee will kill himselfe;</hi> When your meaning is, not that he hath a purpose to <hi>seeke his owne death,</hi> or to <hi>kill himselfe;</hi> but, that if he continue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, and will not follow his <hi>Physitians</hi> wholesome counsaile, death will soone lay him in the pit.</p>
               <p>Now let this rule be laid vnto my <hi>text,</hi> and the scruple, whereof I but now spake, is gone. <hi>A man and his father will goe in vnto the same maide to profane my holy name:</hi> they are the words of my <hi>text;</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> in the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> hath spoken them. But he speaketh after our manner; as we vse to speake: His meaning is, that with the <hi>Israelites</hi> it was an ordinarie matter for <hi>a man and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1741:76"/> to commit filthinesse with the same maide, and that by their so doing, (though themselues had no such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in so doing) <hi>the holy name of God was prophaned.</hi> This <hi>prophanation of Gods holy name</hi> was not the finall cause, it was not the end, why such filthinesse was committed in <hi>Israell.</hi> It was rather the <hi>event,</hi> or <hi>consequent</hi> of it. <hi>Filthinesse</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Israel,</hi> and thereof followed the <hi>prophanation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name of God.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1741:76"/>
                  <hi>sanctified</hi> by men, its out of doubt, <hi>Caput votorum,</hi> the very first petition, which wee are taught to poure forth vnto God, is, that <hi>his name may be sanctified, Hallowed be thy name:</hi> The <hi>name of God</hi> is <hi>holy</hi> in it selfe, it needs not to be <hi>hallowed</hi> by vs; its impossible for vs to adde vnto it any <hi>purity</hi> or <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,</hi> which it had not before. Yet<note n="m" place="margin">Scala coeli. Serm. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Caput votorum,</hi> the first petition of our prayer is, <hi>Hallowed bee thy name.</hi> Our desire therein is, that Gods <hi>name</hi> which is <hi>holy</hi> of it selfe, may bee so accounted off by vs, may bee <hi>holily</hi> vsed by vs, and may, by our <hi>holy</hi> vsage of it, bee manifested to the world, that it is <hi>holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, as the <hi>name</hi> of God is <hi>Hallowed,</hi> when for our <hi>holy</hi> and vnstained liues, men <hi>blesse</hi> the name of God, and praise him: so when for our <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>spotted</hi> liues, men <hi>blaspheme</hi> the name of God, and dishonour him, the <hi>name</hi> of God is <hi>prophaned.</hi> Well then, doth our Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> heere charge the people of <hi>Israel</hi> with <hi>prophanation</hi> of Gods holy name, for asmuch as their liues were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and much spotted. It was with them no strange mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for <hi>a man and his father</hi> to commit filthinesse with the <hi>same Mayde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus haue you the words of my <hi>text</hi> expounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A man and his father]</hi> A sonne and his father, <hi>will goe in vnto the same mayde]</hi> do ordinarily, without feare or shame, commit filthinesse with the same young woman, and so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doe <hi>prophane my holy name]</hi> they cause my name to bee blasphemed, and ill spoken of.</p>
               <p>Two things are heerein remarkable. One is, <hi>the sinne heere obiected to the Israelites:</hi> the other is, <hi>the consequent of this sinne. The sinne</hi> is poynted at in these words, <hi>A man and his father will goe in vnto the same mayde:</hi> the <hi>consequent</hi> in these, <hi>to prophane my holy name.</hi> The <hi>sinne</hi> is <hi>vnlawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> taken either in <hi>incest,</hi> or in <hi>adultery,</hi> or in <hi>fornication,</hi> or in any other <hi>vncleannesse:</hi> the <hi>consequent</hi> is, the <hi>prophaning of the holy name of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrine arising from both, I deliuer in this one position.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1741:77"/>Incestuous persons, adulterers, fornicators, &amp; otherwise shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse sinners, are oftentimes the cause of prophaning the holy name of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Incestuous persons, adulterers</hi> and <hi>fornicators,</hi> all are starke naught: but the <hi>first</hi> are the worst. <hi>Incest, adultery</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> each of them is a <hi>sinne,</hi> that throweth the sinner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the euer-burning lake; yet the most greeuous of them is <hi>incest. Incest!</hi> It is one of the grossest vices of <hi>lust.</hi> Euery mixture of man and woman <hi>of the same kinred,</hi> within the <hi>degrees</hi> forbidden by the law of God, is <hi>Incest.</hi> It is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the seuenth Commandement, wherein, although <hi>adulterie</hi> be onely mentioned, yet vnder that kinde of <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse,</hi> are comprehended and noted, <hi>Sodomitrie, incest, rape, simple fornication,</hi> all the rest, together with their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, occasions, effects, antecedents, and consequents.</p>
               <p>But more precisely is <hi>incest</hi> forbidden, in the eighteenth of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> from the sixth verse to the eighteenth. In the sixth verse, the inhibition is generall: <hi>None of you shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any that is neere of kinne to him, to vncouer</hi> their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse:</hi> I am <hi>the Lord.</hi> It is then the <hi>Lord</hi> that speaketh to you: <hi>None of you shall come neere to any of your kinne, to vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their shame.</hi> But what <hi>kinred</hi> meaneth hee? There is a <hi>kinred</hi> by society of bloud; it is called <hi>consanguinity:</hi> there is also a <hi>kinred</hi> by marriage; it is called <hi>Affinitie.</hi> And to both these <hi>kinreds</hi> will the Lord haue his inhibition to extend: <hi>You shall not approch to any that is neere of kinne to you, to vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their nakednesse,</hi> that is, you may not marry with, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise lustfully abuse any of your <hi>kinred,</hi> be they of your <hi>kinred,</hi> either by <hi>Consanguinity,</hi> or by <hi>Affinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to treat of all these degrees, that are in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> forbidden, were needlesse at this time. One aboue the rest will fit my text. Its that in the eighth verse. <hi>The nakednesse of thy fathers wife thou shalt not vncouer. Thy fathers wise,</hi> that is, thy step-mother, not thine owne mother. Her <hi>nakednesse,</hi> though shee bee but thy <hi>moth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r in law,</hi> thou shalt not <hi>vncouer.</hi> This might haue beene the sin of these <hi>Israelites</hi> in my text. Heere you see, <hi>A sonne and his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1741:77"/> father</hi> went in <hi>vnto the same maide.</hi> If this <hi>maide</hi> were <hi>wife</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>father,</hi> then was shee <hi>stepmother</hi> to the <hi>sonne,</hi> and the <hi>sonne</hi> was <hi>incestuous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>vncleannesse</hi> the very <hi>Heathen</hi> haue detested. <hi>S. Paul</hi> acknowledgeth as much, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>It is reported common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that there is <hi>fornication among you, and such fornication, as is not so much as named amongst the Gentiles, that one should haue his fathers wife. Not so much as named amongst the Gentiles?</hi> What? doe not <hi>Heathen</hi> histories yeeld examples of this <hi>vncleannesse?</hi> They doe.</p>

               <p>Other examples of this <hi>vncleannesse</hi> Heathen histories haue affoorded vs. How then is it, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the but now-alledged place, saith; that this <hi>vncleannesse,</hi> is such as is not so <hi>much as named among the Gentiles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need not fly to an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> to excuse the Apostles assertion. His meaning is, that though such <hi>vncleannesse</hi> were sometime practised among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> lawes were made against it: and that the better sort of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did <hi>detest it,</hi> as a filthie, strange, and monstrous <hi>villanie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was this <hi>vncleannesse</hi> held in such detestation by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1741:78"/> who were guided onely by natures light? No maruaile then is it, if the <hi>Lord,</hi> here in my text, do so sharply reproue <hi>Israel</hi> for this <hi>vncleannesse</hi> among them. <hi>Israel!</hi> They were <hi>the people of the Lord,</hi> they were <hi>his inheritance,</hi> they had the <hi>lampe</hi> of the <hi>word of God</hi> to be their guide. Yet <hi>Israel,</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and disobedient <hi>Israel,</hi> hath played the harlot: <hi>A man and his father</hi> went in <hi>vnto the same maide.</hi> Vnder this one kinde of <hi>incest</hi> are comprehended all the rest; And not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest</hi> onely, but <hi>adulterie</hi> also, yea, and <hi>fornication</hi> too. So that indeed the <hi>Israelites</hi> are here reproued in generall for their <hi>filthie lusts.</hi> They were so inordinately vicious, and so disolute, that they blushed not once, to pollute themselues with <hi>fornication,</hi> with <hi>adulterie,</hi> with <hi>incest,</hi> with all manner of <hi>filthinesse:</hi> and hereby was the holy name of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned.</p>
               <p>It is true. <hi>Peccatorum turpitudine violatur nomen Dei san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum:</hi> such is the <hi>filthinesse</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> that through it, the <hi>holy name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is often violated.

               <p>Let vs now a while consider, what Vse wee may make hereof vnto our selues.</p>

               <p>We <hi>professe</hi> that we <hi>know God,</hi> we <hi>professe</hi> our selues his seruants; walke we therefore worthie of our <hi>profession,</hi> as it becommeth the seruants of God.

For God hath not called vs vnto vncleannesse, but vnto holinesse.</hi> And therefore as the same Apostle aduiseth the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Chap. 5.3. so aduise I you: <hi>Fornication and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse let them not be once named amongst you, as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Saints.</hi> Not once <hi>named!</hi> How then is it that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>nameth</hi> them?

               <p>From hence may you make this Collection: If I may not once <hi>name fornication,</hi> but with <hi>detestation,</hi> then may I not <hi>commit it.</hi> If I may not commit <hi>fornication,</hi> much lesse may I <hi>commit adulterie;</hi> much lesse <hi>incest;</hi> much lesse <hi>some other sinnes of vncleannesse: sinnes</hi> against nature; monstrous and prodigious <hi>sinnes.</hi> Now that we may not <hi>commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> it is euident by these reasons.</p>

I might here produce many goodly sentences, many notable examples of <hi>Ethnickes,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> to shew vnto you the iust punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which for the most part followeth this <hi>detestable vice</hi> hard at the heeles; which might also stirre vs vp to hate it, and to flie from it with all our might.

               <p>Therein also doe we finde, that this filthy sinne, the <hi>sinne of fornication,</hi> is reputed vnlawfull by the very <hi>law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> In <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. it is expressely named among the sins of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were meerely naturall men.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is forbidden in <hi>holy Scripture.</hi> In <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5 3.

               <p>IT is a great height of impietie, whereto men are growne, when by vnlawfull meanes, or pretences, or allurements, they <hi>adde sinne to sinne.</hi> A man may <hi>sinne once</hi> and a <hi>second</hi> time; and may doe it through <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie:</hi> but if he go on with a <hi>third</hi> transgression, and with a <hi>fourth;</hi> if he be obstinate in heaping sinne vpon sinne, lamentable is his estate. A woe must be his portion. Its denounced by the Prophet <hi>Esay, cap.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Woe vnto them, that draw iniquitie with cords of vanitie, and sinne, as it were with a cart-rope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was there euer a people, so far giuen ouer to worke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie? Behold, such were the <hi>people of Israel,</hi> they to whom this prophecie of <hi>Amos</hi> was directed. Their <hi>cruelty,</hi> their <hi>couetousnes,</hi> their <hi>oppressions,</hi> their <hi>calumnies,</hi> their <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lusts</hi> reproued in the two precedent verses, do proclaim as much. And yet they haue not done sinning. They would, I grant, make faire weather; they would make a faire shew, as if their desire were to serue God. For that purpose they came vnto the <hi>house</hi> of their God; his temple; they drew neere vnto his Altars: but euen then did their hearts worke iniquitie. My text conuinceth them.</p>
               <q>They lay themselues downe <hi>[or they lye, or they sit downe]</hi> vpon clothes laid to pledge by euery Altar? and they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1741:84"/> drinke the wine of the condemned <hi>[or of such as they haue fined, or mulcted]</hi> in the house of their Gods.</q>
               <p>The words import thus much. The people of <hi>Israel</hi> to cloke and couer their manifold sinnes, make a shew of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: they goe vnto their temples, the temples of their Idols; there they offer their sacrifices, there they feast it sumptuously. They are at great charges. But whence doe they defray them? Is it out of their owne substance, which either is descended to them by inheritance, or is gotten by their iust and honest labour? No such matter. The fines, the mulcts of the poore, their pawnes, their pledges, their pewter, their garments, their bedding, their goods pay for all.</p>
               <p>The words doe specially concerne the Peeres, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Iudges, the Magistrates, the Rulers of <hi>Israel.</hi> They may also concerne the rich among them: but cannot be vnderstood of the poore, the base, and vulgar sort. The words are not many; yet many are the sinnes they smite at. The <hi>taking of pawnes,</hi> the <hi>deteyning of them, vnrigheous iudgement, superstition, idolatry, riot</hi> and <hi>excesse</hi> are the sins, they smite at; as may in part appeare in the now-ensuing explication.</p>

               <p>Which manner of <hi>sitting,</hi> or <hi>lying downe at meate, Iesus</hi> himselfe seemeth to haue obserued at his celebration of his last Paschall supper.

               </p>
               <p>Euen among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> it was a custome long before. Eight hundred years before the incarnation of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the posteritie of <hi>Iacob</hi> vsed it. My text affirmeth it. The <hi>Israelites,</hi> the of-spring of <hi>Iacob, layd themselues downe vpon clothes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did they <hi>lay themselues downe vpon clothes?</hi> And why might they not doe so? Was not the common custome of so doing, a warrant for them so to doe? Out of doubt it was. It was no fault of theirs to <hi>lye downe at meate,</hi> and <hi>vpon clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes.</hi> But herein were they blame worthie; first, that the <hi>clothes</hi> whereon they <hi>lay,</hi> were not their owne, secondly, that they <hi>lay</hi> vpon them <hi>vnseasonably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>they were not their owne;</hi> they were the <hi>pawnes,</hi> they were the <hi>pledges</hi> of the poore: they were <hi>clothes laid to pledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they <hi>lay vpon them vnseasonablie;</hi> euen <hi>before their Altars.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> argueth their <hi>crueltie</hi> towards the poore: The <hi>second</hi> their <hi>Idolatrie</hi> in respect of God. First of the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They lay themselues downe vpon clothes layd to pledge]</hi> Wee shall the better vnderstand what that sinne is, which our Prophet here reprooueth in the <hi>Israelites,</hi> if we will haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Law concerning <hi>pledges.</hi> That <hi>Law</hi> is written, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26. <hi>If thou at all take thy neighbours raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliuer it vnto him by that the Sunne goeth downe:</hi> The Law is repeated, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>When thou lendest any thing to</hi> thy neighbour, <hi>thou shalt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his house to take his pledge.</hi> But thou shalt abide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1741:85"/>
                  <hi>and the man to whom thou lendest, shall bring the pledge out of the dores vnto thee. And if the man be poore thou shalt not sleepe with his pledge.</hi> But shalt <hi>restore him the pledge when the Sunne goeth downe.</hi> The ground of this Law is <hi>mercy:</hi> the Law-giuer, is the God of <hi>mercy:</hi> its giuen, to stirre vs vp to <hi>mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If at all thou take thy neighbours raiment to pledge, thou must deliuer it vnto him by the going downe of the Sunne.</hi> That is the Law. Thereof, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.27. haue you two reasons: One is taken from common humanitie. The poore mans <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</hi> It is his <hi>onely couering; It is his raiment for his skinne.</hi> Take that from him, and <hi>wherein shall he sleepe? Restore</hi> therefore his <hi>pledge before the Sunne goeth downe.</hi> The other reason is taken from the iudgement of God. If the poore man <hi>crie,</hi> God will <hi>heare</hi> him, for he is <hi>gracious. Restore</hi> thou therefore his <hi>pledge before the Sunne goeth downe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 24. of <hi>Deut. ver.</hi> 13. three reasons are brought to the same purpose. The poore mans <hi>pledge;</hi> See that <hi>in any case</hi> thou <hi>deliuer it, when the Sunne goeth downe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, that <hi>he may sleepe in his owne raiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that <hi>he may blesse thee,</hi> may pray for thee, may testifie vnto God the sence and feeling he hath of thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and kind dealing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that <hi>it may be righteousnesse vnto thee,</hi> euen <hi>before the Lord thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See therefore, that <hi>in any case</hi> thou <hi>restore</hi> the poore mans <hi>pledge, when the Sunne goeth downe.</hi> You haue the <hi>law,</hi> and the <hi>reasons</hi> of the Law.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Law</hi> these <hi>Israelites</hi> violated. <hi>They tooke to pledge poore mens clothes,</hi> they deteined them, they vsed them, they <hi>lay vpon them,</hi> as if they had beene their owne. The sinne then here laid vnto their charge, is <hi>Detentio pignoris paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the keeping backe of the poore mans <hi>pledge.</hi> The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which we may take from hence, is this,
<q>The pledge of a poore man, such as is necessarie for his vse, is not to be withholden from him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I say, such as is necessarie for his vse. <hi>Moses,</hi> in the alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1741:86"/> places of <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> makes mention of his <hi>raiment.</hi> The <hi>raiment</hi> of the poore man▪ it is <hi>operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> his couering; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is <hi>vestimentum,</hi> his clothing: he hath nothing else, wherewith to hide his nakednesse: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, wherewith to saue himselfe from cold. Such a <hi>pledge,</hi> as is the poore mans <hi>raiment,</hi> his <hi>coat,</hi> his <hi>dublet,</hi> his <hi>bed,</hi> his <hi>couering,</hi> or any other thing, that is <hi>necessarie for the preseruing of his life,</hi> God will haue it <hi>restored.</hi> Yet it will please him well, if <hi>such a pledge be neuer taken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law runnes thus in the 22. of <hi>Exodus. If at all thou take thy neigbbours raiment to pledge, thou must deliuer it vnto him by the going downe of the Sunne.</hi> It is as if the <hi>Lord</hi> had thus said: I shall like it well, if thou <hi>lend</hi> vnto thy poore neighbour <hi>without taking any pledge of him;</hi> but if thou be so cruell, and hard hearted, as that thou wilt not be induced to <hi>lend</hi> without taking of a pawne, yet see in any case, that <hi>thou restore vnto him his pawne before the Sunne goeth downe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords desire to haue no <hi>pawne</hi> at all taken of the poore man, is more plainely manifested, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.6. The Law there is: <hi>No man shall take the two mil-stones, or the vpper mil-stone to pledge.</hi> Mention is made first of <hi>two milstones,</hi> and then of the <hi>vppermost.</hi> It is all one as if the <hi>Lord</hi> had sayd: <hi>You shall not take to pledge both milstones, no nor one of them.</hi> As good take <hi>both,</hi> as <hi>one.</hi> There is no grinding without <hi>both.</hi> If thou take <hi>one</hi> and leaue the <hi>other,</hi> how shall the poore man <hi>grind? Milstones</hi> are named: vnder them by a <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche</hi> you may comprehend all kind of vtensils, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with which a poore man gets his liuing. In this ranke I place the Husbandmans plow, the Smithes anvill, the Taylors sheares, and euery other handy-crafts mans toole, which is necessarie for the exercise of his trade or occupation. <hi>None such</hi> may you take to <hi>pawne. Moses</hi> adds the reason: For, he that takes such a pawne of a poore man, <hi>takes the poore mans life to pawne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May not such a pawne be taken by the<note n="h" place="margin">

               <p>This doctrine hath its vse in this <hi>wringing</hi> world. It may serue to reproue the <hi>wealthie,</hi> the <hi>great deuourers,</hi> the <hi>Sea-gulfs</hi> of this age.

               </p>
               <p>Foolish man! Why pleadest thou so? It is the will of God, that <hi>thou lend without a pawne:</hi> or if thou <hi>lend vpon a pawne,</hi> that thou <hi>restore it before the Sunne goe downe.</hi> This is the will of God: Why wilt thou not obey it?</p>
               <p>Say; thou <hi>lendest</hi> a poore man <hi>thy money,</hi> and he buyeth bread therewith, &amp; eateth; and in the meane time through want of his <hi>raiment,</hi> which thou hast to <hi>pawne,</hi> the poore man be <hi>frozen to death:</hi> how hast thou relieued him? What difference is there, whether he die for <hi>hunger,</hi> or for <hi>cold?</hi> If thou slacke his <hi>hunger,</hi> and starue him with <hi>cold,</hi> thou dost but <hi>change his torment;</hi> thou dost not succour him.

               </p>
               <p>Flatter not thy selfe (beloued) whosoeuer thou art, that hast accustomed thy selfe to secure the <hi>loane of thy money</hi> by taking of <hi>pawnes.</hi> If the course be simply and absolutely lawfull, what meaneth the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Thou shalt not take a widdowes raiment to pledge?</hi> And why doth <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 24.3. reproue them, <hi>who take the widdowes oxe for a pledge?</hi> It is in thy power I grant, to <hi>take a pledge</hi> of thy deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to assure thy selfe, that thou maiest receiue thine owne againe: but if in <hi>taking thy pledge,</hi> thou transgresse the Law of charitie; if thou take <hi>such a pledge,</hi> as thy neighbour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>But here thou wilt apologize, defend thy selfe, &amp; plead that <hi>for thy taking of pawnes,</hi> thou hast thy warrant out of <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.16.

No. But <hi>of him,</hi> who rashly, vnaduisedly, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishly becomes suertie vnto thee, for the man he knoweth not.

               </p>
               <p>I put thee a case: Thou lendest <hi>tenne pounds,</hi> vpon a <hi>pawne</hi> of <hi>bedding,</hi> or <hi>linnen,</hi> and thou lendest it <hi>freely:</hi> but as the <hi>borrower</hi> vseth <hi>thy money,</hi> so <hi>thou</hi> vsest <hi>his pawne.</hi> This is <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury</hi> in thee. For the <hi>bedding</hi> or <hi>linnen,</hi> which thou hast in <hi>pawne</hi> is the worse for the wearing: so is not <hi>thy money</hi> in the borrowers hand. I know the very name of <hi>Vsury</hi> is detested of thee, and thou hatest to be called an <hi>Ʋsurer.</hi> Take heed then, that by thy <hi>taking of pawnes,</hi> thou become not one of that <hi>damned crew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore you haue taken <hi>any pawne</hi> of a poore man, <hi>any such pawne,</hi> as by the Law thou oughtest not to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him, <hi>restore it</hi> vnto him according to the Law, euen <hi>before the Sunne goe downe.</hi> So shall the <hi>poore man,</hi> to whom thou hast <hi>shewed mercy in lending thy money,</hi> blesse thee, and it shall be <hi>righteousnesse vnto thee before the Lord thy God.</hi> Hereof art thou assured, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.13.

               <p>This <hi>one Altar</hi> at first was to be made of <hi>earth,</hi> or of <hi>stone rough and vnhewen,</hi> as appeareth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24.25.

               <p>THis is the last branch in the enumeration of the sinnes of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> It concerneth the Iudges of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Rulers of that state; them prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally. It is appliable to others also, to the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sort. The words are a reproofe of the grosse superstition of that people. They thought their dutie touching the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, well discharged, so they repaired to their <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> Such holy places they thought were of themselues sufficient to clense them, albeit they should euen there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselues to inordinate <hi>eating,</hi> to vnmeasurable <hi>drinking,</hi> to infamous <hi>luxurie,</hi> yea, to euery kinde of <hi>villanie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my more plaine proceeding in the handling of the words of this text, will you be pleased to note in them,</p>
               <p>First, the action, for which the <hi>Israelites</hi> are here repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; it is a <hi>drinking</hi> of <hi>wine. They drinke wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>whose wine</hi> it is, they drinke. Its not their owne; its <hi>vinum damnatorum;</hi> it's the wine of the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>They drinke the wine of the condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>where</hi> they drinke it. They drinke it not at home, which were more tolerable; but <hi>in domo deorum suorum,</hi> in the house of their Gods. <hi>They drinke the wine of the condemned in the house of their Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first convinceth them of <hi>riot,</hi> and <hi>excesse. They drinke wine</hi> immoderately. They are so giuen to it, that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1741:93"/> they absteine not euen then, when they are in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and would seeme most religious. For they <hi>drinke</hi> it <hi>in the house of their Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second convinceth them of <hi>oppression.</hi> The wine they drinke, is <hi>vinum damnatorum;</hi> it is the wine of the condemned: it is <hi>vinum mulctatorum,</hi> the <hi>wine</hi> of such as they haue <hi>fined</hi> or <hi>mulcted: wine,</hi> bought with the money of them, whom they haue in their vnrighteous iudgments spoyled of their goods.</p>
               <p>The third conuinceth them of <hi>idolatry.</hi> They drinke their wine in the house of <hi>their Gods;</hi> not in the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that once glorious <hi>Temple</hi> of the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, but in the temple of <hi>their gods,</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> and other places, before their <hi>golden calues</hi> and other their <hi>Idols. They drinke the wine of the condemned in the house of their Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>They drinke wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wine!</hi> Why might they not? Is it not one of the <hi>good</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4.</note>
                  <hi>creatures</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that may well be vsed with <hi>thanksgiuing?</hi> God himselfe giues it to the <hi>obedient,</hi> to them that <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>serue him, Deut.</hi> 11.14. <hi>I will giue you the raine of your land in due season, the first raine and the latter raine, that thou maist gather in thy corne, and thy wine, and thine oyle.</hi> That thou maist gather in <hi>thy wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ his miraculous turning of <hi>water</hi> into <hi>wine</hi> at the marriage of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee, Ioh.</hi> 2.11. is euidence enough that he allowed the <hi>drinking</hi> of <hi>wine.</hi> Yea, himselfe <hi>dranke wine.</hi> Else the people would neuer haue called him a <hi>wine-bibber,</hi> as it appeareth they did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.19. <hi>S Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. wisheth <hi>Timothie</hi> no longer to <hi>drinke water,</hi> but <hi>to vse a little wine for his stomackes sake.</hi> Wine hath its praises in the Scripture. It <hi>makes glad the heart of man, Psal.</hi> 104.15. It <hi>cheareth God and man, Iudg.</hi> 9.13.</p>
               <p>How then is it, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> are here reproued for <hi>drinking wine?</hi> I answer, not for <hi>drinking wine,</hi> but for the <hi>abuse in drinking</hi> are the <hi>Israelites</hi> here reproued. It is with <hi>wine,</hi> as it is with euery other <hi>good creature</hi> of God. It may
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1741:94"/> be abused. <hi>Wine</hi> is abused, when men are <hi>drunken</hi> with it. This <hi>abuse of wine, S. Paul</hi> desirous either to preuent, or to reforme in the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> thus speaketh to the <hi>Ephesians, chap.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be yee not drunke with wine, wherein is excesse.</hi> It is as if he had said: <hi>Take heed of wine;</hi> be not ouercome of it. <hi>In vino luxus.</hi> Consider the man that is giuen ouer to <hi>drunkennesse.</hi> His life its profuse, its dissolute, its vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, its luxurious, its vnworthy a Christian. <hi>Take heed of wine.</hi>

                  <hi>Salomon, Prouerb.</hi> 20.1. saith: <hi>Wine is a mocker.</hi> It is so: <hi>wine</hi> taken immoderately deceiues him that takes it. He takes it to be <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>pleasant,</hi> but will finde it in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect exceeding <hi>bitter.</hi> What more <hi>bitter</hi> then <hi>drunkennes?</hi> and what causeth <hi>drunkennesse</hi> more then wine? <hi>Aufert memori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> said to be <hi>S. Austines. Drunkennesse!</hi> it takes away the <hi>memorie,</hi> it consumes the <hi>senses,</hi> it confounds the <hi>vnderstanding,</hi> it prouoketh <hi>lust,</hi> it weakneth the bodie, it driues life away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>drunkard</hi> is notably deciphered by the same Father in his booke <hi>de poenitentiá. Quùm absorbet vinum, absorbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à vino;</hi> the <hi>drunkard</hi> while he deuoureth his wine, is deuoured of his wine: <hi>abominatur à Deo, despicitur ab An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelis, deridetur ab hominibus, destituitur virtutibus, confundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à daemonibus, conculcatur ab omnibus.

               <p>At the time of Christs suffering, there were in Ierusalem certaine devout Matrons, full of compassion, who did out of their devotion bestow this <hi>wine.</hi> This <hi>wine</hi> so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, for Christ, and those that suffered with him, some cruell Iewes tooke vnto themselues, according to these words of <hi>Amos, They drinke the wine of the condemned.</hi> This wine they tooke vnto themselues, and in the place thereof they did put <hi>vinegar</hi> mixt with <hi>gall,</hi> as <hi>S. Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>chap.</hi> 27.34. If <hi>vinegar</hi> mixt with <hi>gall</hi> might serue Christs turne, so it was: the Iewes would haue the wine: <hi>They would drinke the wine of the condemned.</hi>

If to this custome our Prophet here alludeth, then are the <hi>Israelites</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for their cruelty, for taking to themselues, to their owne priuate vse, what was of custome belonging to poore <hi>condemned prisoners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I take it more agreable to the meaning of the Holy Ghost in this place, if we vnderstand by <hi>the wine of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</hi> wine bought with the money of such as the Iudges of Israel had in their vnrighteous iudgements put to the worse.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>vinum de calumnijs,</hi> wine gotten by deceitfull dealing, by malitious surmises, by false accusations. The <hi>Chaldee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrast</hi> tearmes it <hi>vinum rapinae,</hi> the wine of oppression, of pillage, of robberie. <hi>Luther</hi> stiles it <hi>vinum mulctatorum;</hi> and <hi>Castalio, vinum mulctatitiū,</hi> wine issuing from mulctes, from fines. In our now English translation, it is <hi>the wine of the condemned:</hi> cast your eye but to the margent, and you will finde it to bee the wine of such as were <hi>fined</hi> or <hi>mulcted.</hi> Here then by <hi>the wine of the condemned,</hi> we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the Iudges of <hi>Israel</hi> laid vpon the poore men vniust penalties, by which they might be prouided of wine and other delicates, and so spend their dayes in iollity.</p>
               <p>You see now, what sinne it is, whereat this second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall part doth aime. It is an <hi>oppressing</hi> sinne; the sinne of <hi>oppression:</hi> when Iudges, rulers of states, and men in autoritie <hi>make hauocke of the poore.</hi> Of this sinne I spake at large in my Ninth Lecture vpon this second chapter of <hi>Amos;</hi> at what time I deliuered this doctrine.</p>
               <q>God pleadeth the cause of the poore, against their oppressors.</q>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1741:97"/>
               <p>The lesse neede haue I now to spend my time vpon it. Yet a word of it. My now-doctrine I deliuer in this positiō:
<q>It is not lawfull for any man to oppresse another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oppression</hi> I call euery <hi>iniustice,</hi> vsed of the mightier, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by violence, or by colour of law, or by any other cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dealing, against such as are not able to withstand them.</p>
               <p>This description of oppression, I gather from <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.14. from <hi>Micah</hi> 2.1, 2. and from 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.6. In ech place the vnlawfulnesse of oppression is manifested.</p>
               <p>The first place is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.14. The commandement there is: <hi>If thou sell ought vnto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbors hand, yee shall not oppresse one another.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you <hi>sell</hi> or <hi>buy,</hi> you may not <hi>oppresse:</hi> the very forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>oppression,</hi> is a sufficient argument, that <hi>oppression</hi> is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>The second place is, <hi>Micah</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Woe to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise iniquitie, and worke euill vpon their beds: when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hands. And they couet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away. So they oppresse a man and his house, euen a man and his heritage.</hi> where you haue an imprecation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>oppressors,</hi> a <hi>woe</hi> thundred out against them. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to proue <hi>oppression</hi> to be vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>The third place is, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.6. <hi>This is the will of God, that no man oppresse, or ouer-reach his brother in any matter.</hi> Is it <hi>Gods will?</hi> Then surely it is not lawfull for you to <hi>oppresse</hi> or <hi>ouer-reach</hi> one another in any businesse. Men of trade may not gaine by their false <hi>weights,</hi> false <hi>measures,</hi> false <hi>speeches,</hi> or <hi>false oathes;</hi> neither may men in any other course of life gaine by <hi>violence,</hi> or by <hi>colour of Law,</hi> or by any other <hi>cunning dealing.</hi> Thus is my doctrine confirmed,
<q>It is not lawfull for any man to oppresse another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>First, it may serue for a reproofe of the <hi>Oppressors</hi> of this age, who make <hi>gold</hi> their <hi>hope,</hi> and the <hi>wedge of gold</hi> their <hi>confidence,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 31.24. <hi>S. Paul,</hi> he taught, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. that <hi>Godlinesse is great gaine:</hi> but these men sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1741:97"/> the contrary, that <hi>gaine</hi> is great godlinesse: and therefore they feare not to <hi>gaine</hi> with the hurt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>They build their <hi>houses, as the moth.</hi> So saith <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 27.18. As the <hi>moth!</hi> How is that? The <hi>moth</hi> is made full by spoyling the barkes, and bookes wherein it liueth. So is it with these men; they make themselues full, by spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling others, with whom they liue, and haue to deale. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it in <hi>Ieremies</hi> phrase, <hi>chap.</hi> 22.13. They <hi>build</hi> their houses <hi>by vnrighteousnes,</hi> and their <hi>chambers by wrong:</hi> and in <hi>Habakkuks</hi> phrase, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.12. They <hi>build</hi> them townes <hi>with blood,</hi> and <hi>stablish</hi> their Cities <hi>by iniquitie.</hi> Against these is that complaint of the Lord, <hi>Esai.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Ye haue eaten vp the vineyard; the spoyle of the poore is in your houses. What meane yee, that yee beat my people to peeces, and grinde the faces of the poore? Woe</hi> to these men; a <hi>woe</hi> from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> a <hi>woe</hi> from <hi>Ieremie,</hi> a <hi>woe</hi> from <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in the now-alleaged places; a <hi>woe</hi> from <hi>Esay</hi> too, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Woe</hi> vpon <hi>woe</hi> and yet will they not cease from ioyning <hi>house to house,</hi> and laying <hi>land to land,</hi> as if the way to the spirituall <hi>Canaan</hi> were all by <hi>Land,</hi> and not through <hi>a red Sea of death,</hi> as one wittily speaketh.</p>
               <p>From this contempt of the Prophets of the <hi>Lord,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe speaking by his Prophets, it is now come to passe, that many a poore tenant is <hi>thrust out of his house;</hi> that Villages are <hi>depopulated,</hi> that those streets which were wont to be sowen with the seeds of men, are now become pastures for the <hi>sending forth of oxen,</hi> and for <hi>the treading of sheepe,</hi> as <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.25.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus haue you the first vse of my doctrine. My
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1741:98"/> doctrine was, <hi>It is not lawfull for any man to oppresse another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vse was a generall reproofe of our <hi>now-oppressors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A second vse may be to admonish <hi>Iudges, Iustices,</hi> and other <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> that they suffer not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be stained with this sin of <hi>oppression.</hi> It is the<note n="o" place="margin">Pilkinton ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit. in Nehem. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This dutie is laid vpon him, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 21.12. There thus saith the <hi>Lord</hi> to the house of <hi>Dauid: Execute iudgem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt in the morning, and deliuer him that is oppressed out of the hand of the oppressor.</hi> It is likewise laid vpon him, <hi>Esai.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Seeke iudgement, releeue the oppressed, iudge the fatherlesse, and defend the widow.</hi> Where first Gods commandement is, that Magistrates should <hi>execute iudgement in the morning.</hi> In the <hi>morning:</hi> Therefore they are not to vse delayes in doing iustice. Secondly, Gods commandement is, that Magistrates should <hi>seeke iudgement.</hi> Must they <hi>seeke iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Therefore in cases of <hi>oppression</hi> they are not to stay till they be called for. Thirdly, God commendeth vnto Magistrates, all that are <hi>oppressed,</hi> but specially the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse</hi> and <hi>widow:</hi> the <hi>fatherlesse,</hi> because they want the defence of their parents; and the <hi>widow,</hi> because she is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the helpe of her husband; and we know, euery man goeth ouer, where the hedge is lowest. Therefore are Magistrates to take vpon them the defence of the <hi>father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,</hi> the defence of the <hi>widow,</hi> the defence of <hi>euery one, that is oppressed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it so? Then are Magistrates to take speciall heed, that themselues be neither principalls, nor accessaries, in the sin of <hi>Oppression.</hi> They must abhor the practise of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ierusalem, who <hi>Esay</hi> 1.23. are stiled <hi>companions of theeues,</hi> because they <hi>loued gifts,</hi> and <hi>followed after rewards.</hi> They are to detest the corruption of the rulers of <hi>Israel,</hi> who <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.18. loue <hi>with shame</hi> to cry, <hi>Bring yee, Bring yee.</hi> They must hate the wayes of <hi>Samuels</hi> sonnes, who 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.3. <hi>turned aside after lucre, tooke bribes, and peruerted iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:1741:99"/> They must loath the courses of cursed <hi>Balaam,</hi> who 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Loued the wages of vnrighteousnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Happy is the land that is ruled by such Magistrates. Such may with boldnes stand vp, and make protestation with iust and vncorrupt <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Behold, here</hi> we are; <hi>witnesse against</hi> vs: <hi>whose oxe haue</hi> we <hi>taken? whom haue</hi> we <hi>defrauded? whom haue</hi> we <hi>oppressed? of whose hand haue</hi> we <hi>receiued any bribes to blinde our eyes therewith?</hi> and no man shall be able to accuse them.</p>
               <p>Are ours such? I stand not here to plead against them. Onely this I say: If ours be not such, but are of another stampe: if they <hi>loue the wages of vnrighteousnesse,</hi> if they <hi>loue gifts,</hi> if they <hi>follow after rewards,</hi> if they <hi>turne aside after lucre,</hi> if they <hi>take bribes,</hi> if they shame not to cry, <hi>Bring ye, bring yee;</hi> I may ranke them with these <hi>Israelites</hi> in my text: They will <hi>sell the righteous for siluer;</hi> they will <hi>sell the poore for a paire of shoes;</hi> they will <hi>pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poore;</hi> they will <hi>turne aside the way of the meeke,</hi> and they will <hi>drinke the wine of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus haue you the second vse of my doctrine. My do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was, <hi>It is not lawfull for any man to oppresse another.</hi> The vse was an admonition to <hi>Magistrates, rulers,</hi> and other <hi>officers,</hi> that they suffer not themselues to be stained with the sinne of <hi>oppression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third vse followeth. It reacheth to the <hi>poore oppressed.</hi> They may from hence receiue consolation; from hence they may be comforted. Is it not an exceeding great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to a <hi>poore oppressed</hi> wretch, to know, that God taketh notice of the oppressions, vnder which he groaneth? That God doth so, I haue already made it manifest in the proofe of my doctrine, in the reproofe of <hi>oppressors,</hi> and in the Magistrates admonition. It is cleare also in the letter of my text. Here God taketh notice of the <hi>oppressions</hi> of the <hi>poore</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> in as much as the Iudges, the Rulers, and great men there did <hi>drinke the wine of the condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereto I adde that <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.5. <hi>For the oppression of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1741:99"/> poore, for the sighing of the needie, now will I arise (saith the Lord) I will set him in safetie from him that puffeth at him,</hi> from him that would ensnare him. Behold here, first <hi>Gods readinesse to helpe the poore,</hi> and secondly, <hi>how forcible with God the poore mans prayers are.</hi> Are not both these to a <hi>poore oppressed</hi> man points of singular comfort? Out of doubt they are.</p>
               <p>But some <hi>poore man</hi> pressed downe with the burden of oppression, may here say vnto me. Hath God promised <hi>to deliuer me from mine oppressors?</hi> Why then am I still oppressed?</p>
               <p>Stay a while, and thou shalt behold the goodnes of the Lord. Its not for thee to make haste, or to seeke by vile, and vnwarrantable courses to winde thy selfe out of thine oppressors hands. Vntill it shall please the Lord to put an end to thy present grieuances, its thy dutie to possesse thy soule in patience. Prescribe not thou vnto the Lord, what he shall doe. Let his <hi>grace,</hi> let his <hi>fauour</hi> be sufficient for thee, whatsoeuer it bring with it; be it want, or pouertie, or aduersitie. One drop of his <hi>fauour</hi> is better worth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and more of valew, then this whole world. If thou haue but a tast, but a touch of it, it will make thee sing with <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>Its good for me that I haue bin afflicted: good,</hi> that I haue bin in want, in pouertie, in aduersitie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the griping hand of the <hi>oppressor.</hi> O! how sweet is the quiet <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>righteousnes,</hi> that springeth forth from the bitter <hi>roote</hi> of <hi>tribulation!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I haue done with the <hi>poore oppressed,</hi> when I shall haue giuen them a <hi>Caveat.</hi> The <hi>Caveat</hi> is, that <hi>they themselues oppresse not themselues.</hi> There is no <hi>oppression</hi> to the <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> that one <hi>poore man</hi> exerciseth towards another. For <hi>a poore man that oppresseth the poore, is like a sweeping raine, that leaues no foode.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1741:100"/> by him he may be put in minde of his owne estate, <hi>he is like a sweeping raine]</hi> like a floud that riseth through abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of raine, or he is like a great storme and tempest of raine, that suddenly carieth away corne, hay, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it meeteth with, and <hi>leaues behinde it no foode</hi> for men or cattle to liue on. <hi>A poore man if he oppresse the poore, is like a sweeping raine, that leaues no foode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>poore man,</hi> and yet an <hi>oppressor!</hi> Such a one is much more intolerable then a <hi>rich man,</hi> that <hi>oppresseth.</hi> For, whereas by the law of God, euery <hi>oppressor</hi> is bound to make <hi>actuall restitution</hi> for the wrongs he hath done, the <hi>rich man</hi> may bee in case to doe it, the <hi>poore man</hi> neuer.</p>
               <p>My exhortation is, to rich, to poore, to all; that all would <hi>be of the same minde one towards another.</hi> So <hi>S.

If it be possible, as much as lyeth in you, liue peaceably with all men.</hi> Sith <hi>here we haue no continuing citie, Heb.</hi> 13.14. sith here we are but <hi>pilgrims</hi> and <hi>strangers,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. sith <hi>here is not our rest, Micah</hi> 2.10. why vse we <hi>fraudulencie</hi> and <hi>forgerie</hi> in our contracts? why <hi>bribery</hi> in iustice? why <hi>crueltie</hi> in our dealings? why ouer-beare we right by <hi>might?</hi> why <hi>grinde</hi> we the poore like corne with the <hi>milstones</hi> of <hi>oppression?</hi> why eat we them vp like bread? yea, why doe the poore <hi>grinde</hi> themselues? why oppresse they one another? Will we neuer leaue crushing one another? Dearely beloued, we forget our selues: we thinke we are at <hi>home,</hi> but are not.

                  <hi>Not in the seruice of God.</hi> They are reiected by <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticus,</hi> chap. 34.18. <hi>He that sacrificeth of a thing wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gotten, his offering is ridiculous. Ridiculous!</hi> And will you thinke a <hi>ridiculous offering</hi> fit for Gods seruice? In the 20. vers. of the same Chapter <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith further: <hi>Who so bringeth an offering of the goods of the poore, doth as one that killeth the sonne before the fathers eyes.</hi> Can a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> be pleased to haue his <hi>sonne</hi> slaine before his eyes? You will say, no. No more will it be pleasing to God to haue <hi>an offering of ill gotten goods</hi> presented to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> Prov. 15.8. saith, <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> He saith it againe, <hi>chap.</hi> 21.27. <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination.</hi> Its true.

Of such sacrificers he saith in <hi>Esay, chap.</hi> 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an oxe, is as if he slue a man: he that sacrificeth a lambe,</hi> as <hi>he that cut off a dogs neck, he that offereth an oblation,</hi> as if <hi>he offered swines flesh, he that burneth incense,</hi> as if he <hi>blessed an Idol.</hi>

               <p>But may they be employed <hi>in the seruice of Idols? No,</hi> they may not. My reason is: The <hi>Idolater</hi> hauing no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of the true and liui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

This is the very reason why our Prophet here reproueth the Israelites for bringing into the Temples of their Idols, their ill-gotten goods, <hi>the wine of the condemned.</hi> They thought thereby to do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, not so much to their <hi>Idols,</hi> as to the great <hi>God</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whom by their Idols they represented. Thus haue you my whole doctrine established,
<q>Goods gotten vnlawfully are not fit to be employed in the seruice of God: No, nor in the seruice of Idols.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This may serue to admonish such, as shall hereafter found <hi>Colleges,</hi> build <hi>Hospitals,</hi> erect <hi>Scholes,</hi> ordaine <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,</hi> that they endow them not, that they enrich them not with lands and possessions, purchased with <hi>ill-gotten</hi> treasure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is a lesson for all such as haue heaped vp vnto themselues abundance of wealth by <hi>oppression,</hi> by <hi>extortion,</hi> by <hi>vsury,</hi> by <hi>deceit,</hi> or otherwise vnlawfully. Such may here be put in minde to make <hi>actuall restitution</hi> in their life time. Happily they will by their last Will and Testament bequeath part of their <hi>ill-gotten</hi> wealth to the <hi>Church,</hi> and part to the <hi>poore,</hi> and will leaue but a portion to their <hi>heires.</hi> A poore shift.

               <p>What remaineth then, but that euery one, who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased his substance <hi>by wrong,</hi> doe while he is liuing, make <hi>actuall restitution. Zacheus</hi> the <hi>Publican</hi> professeth vnto Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Behold Lord, the halfe of my goods I giue to the poore, and if I haue taken any thing from any man, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged cavillation, I restore him foure-fold. Zacheus</hi> of <hi>Iericho,</hi> he being converted to Christianitie was content <hi>to restore foure-fold.</hi> It is a good consequent, they are scarse halfe Christians, that will not <hi>restore the principall.</hi> Thou wilt say, what neede <hi>restitution?</hi> I will <hi>repent</hi> for my <hi>oppressing</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1741:102"/> sinnes, and God is gracious; he neuer turnes away the sinner that <hi>repenteth.</hi> Take heede, deceiue not thy selfe: if thou be able to make <hi>actuall restitution,</hi> and doest it not, <hi>poenitentia non agitur, sed fingitur. S.

                     <p>Yet destroyed I the <hi>Amorite</hi> before them, whose height was like the height of the <hi>Cedars,</hi> and he was strong as the <hi>Okes,</hi> yet I destroyed his fruit from aboue, and his rootes from beneath.</p>
                     <p>Also I brought you vp from the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and led you fortie yeares through the wildernesse, to possesse the land of the <hi>Amorite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I raised vp of your sonnes for Prophets, and of your yong men for <hi>Nazarites.</hi> Is it not euen thus, O yee children of Israel, saith the Lord?</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>MY meditations haue beene heretofore fiue times exercised in discoursing vnto you of the <hi>sinnes,</hi> wherewith the people of <hi>Israel</hi> in the precedent verses stand charged. Their sinnes were, <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, Crueltie, Oppression, False dealing, Filthie lusts, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, Idolatrie, Riot,</hi> and <hi>Excesse.</hi> Grosse and palpable enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. My endeuour was by <hi>the sword of the Spirit,</hi> the word of God, to arme you against them, that yee giue them no passage, no not a little; that yee suffer them not by any meanes to haue dominion ouer you.</p>
               <p>From their <hi>sinnes</hi> we come to their <hi>Blessings;</hi> those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings wherewith God had blessed them. Foure are heere mentioned.</p>
               <p>One is, the <hi>ruine of the Amorites,</hi> set downe verse 9. <hi>Yet destroyed I the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them, whose height was like the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1741:103"/> height of the</hi> Cedars, <hi>and he was strong as the</hi> Okes, <hi>yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed his fruit from aboue, and his rootes from beneath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is, <hi>their deliuera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e from the seruitude of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. ver. 10. <hi>Also I brought you vp from the land of</hi> Egypt.</p>
               <p>The third is, <hi>their safe passage through the desert,</hi> touched in the same verse; <hi>I led you fortie yeares through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And why so? but, <hi>to possesse the land of the</hi> Amorite.</p>
               <p>These were three great blessings; yet were they but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. The fourth passeth; It is spirituall, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>I raysed vp of your sonnes for Prophets, and of your young men for</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:</p>
               <p>The confirmation of all followeth in the same verse: <hi>Is it not euen thus, O yee children of Israel, sayth the Lord?</hi> Say O yee children of <hi>Israel;</hi> Haue I not done so and so for you? Haue I not destroyed the <hi>Amorite</hi> for your sake? Haue I not freed you from your <hi>Egyptian</hi> yoke? Haue I not guided you through <hi>the desert?</hi> Haue I not giuen you <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Nazarites</hi> of your owne <hi>sonnes,</hi> and of your owne <hi>yong men</hi> for your instruction in the true seruice and worship of your God? <hi>Is it euen thus, O yee children of Israel, saith the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You haue now the scope of my Prophet, and the summe of this Scripture. My present discourse must begin with the first mentioned benefit bestowed by God vpon that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is the <hi>ruine of the Amorites</hi> for their sake, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Yet destroyed I the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Herein I commend vnto you three principall parts;</p>
               <p>The first hath a generall touch of the <hi>ruine of the</hi> Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>The second hath a description of that people. They are described, from their <hi>stature,</hi> and from their <hi>valour.</hi> Each is set forth vnto vs by way of comparison: their stature or tallnesse by the <hi>Cedar,</hi> their valour or strength by the <hi>Oke; Their height was like the height of the</hi> Cedars, <hi>and hee was strong as the</hi> Okes.</p>
               <p>The third hath a particular explication or amplification of their ruine; It was not any gentle stripe that they recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, not any light incision, not any small wound; but it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1741:103"/> was their extermination, their contrition, their vniuersall ouerthrow, their vtter ruine. Their <hi>roote</hi> and <hi>fruit;</hi> Princes and subiects; Parents and children, yong and old, were all brought to nought: <hi>Yet I destroyed his fruit from aboue, and his rootes from beneath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the first of these three parts at this time. It hath a generall touch of the <hi>ruine of the</hi> Amorites. <hi>Yet I destroyed the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them.</hi>

There are the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> sayd to be without excuse, <hi>Because when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were they thankefull.</hi> Hee <hi>reprehendeth</hi> it in the proud Christian, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.

And if thou hast receiued it, why doest thou glory, why</hi> boasteth thou <hi>as if thou hadst not receiued?</hi> It is a <hi>reprehension</hi> of Vnthankfulnesse which you haue, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25 26. There the seruant that receiued of his Master <hi>one Talent</hi> to be employed to the best aduantage, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not, is thus checked: <hi>Thou wicked and slothfull seruant, thou knowest that I reape, where I sowed not, and gather where I haue not strawed: Thou oughtest therefore to haue put my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the exchangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may not passe by <hi>Iesus</hi> his censure, which he giueth of the Leapers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.17. It is a reprehension of their Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse. <hi>Tenne</hi> were clensed: onely <hi>one,</hi> and he a <hi>Samaritane,</hi> returned to giue thankes. It drew from <hi>Iesus</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1741:104"/> this expostulation: <hi>Were there not ten clensed? but where are the nine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me recall you to review that reproofe of Vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, <hi>Esa.</hi> 1.2.

               <p>Marke, I beseech you, how the <hi>Lord</hi> goeth on to ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this Vnthankefulnesse of his people, ver. 3. <hi>The oxe knoweth his owner, and the asse his Masters crib, but</hi> Israel <hi>doth not know, my people doth not consider.</hi> See you not, how God setteth his people, as it were to Schoole, to the <hi>Oxe,</hi> and to the <hi>Asse,</hi> to learne of them what their dutie is?

               <p>It was a <hi>thankefull Lyon,</hi> that followed <hi>Gerasimus</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot to keepe his Asses: the kindnesse that the Abbot had done to the <hi>Lyon,</hi> was done at the riuer <hi>Iordan.</hi> It was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but the remoouing of a little bramble from the <hi>Lyons</hi> foote; It was a kindnesse, and the <hi>Lyon</hi> did him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice for it.

A <hi>serpent</hi> that had gotten this <hi>Lyon</hi> at the aduantage, and was like to be his executioner, was slaine by this souldier: This was a kindnesse, and the <hi>Lyon</hi> was thankefull for it.

               <p>The <hi>punishments</hi> wherewith God repayeth <hi>vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> are of two sorts. They are eyther <hi>Temporall</hi> or <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among <hi>Temporall</hi> punishments I ranke the losse of the commodities of this life.</p>
               <p>Such a punishment, a temporall punishment it was, wherwith God repayed the <hi>Vnthankefulnesse</hi> of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wildernesse of <hi>Pharan,</hi> at <hi>Kibroth-Hattaanah,</hi> or the <hi>graues of lust,</hi> their thirteenth mansion, so called because there<note n="u" place="margin">

               <p>Thus is <hi>Ʋnthankefulnesse</hi> repayed with temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is repaid likewise with <hi>Eternall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Eternall</hi> punishment it is, which is adiudged to the <hi>vnthankefull,</hi> and vnprofitable seruant, in the parable of the talents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Cast him into vtter darkenes; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi>

Euery day should we recount in our minds, <hi>all the good things which God hath done for vs all our life long, euen from our youth.</hi> Here to are we exhorted by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.18. <hi>In euery thing giue thankes.</hi> His exhortation is made strong with a reason annexed. <hi>For this is the will of God in Christ Iesus concerning you.</hi> The like exhortation is made to the <hi>Colossians, chap.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Be yee thankefull,</hi> and ver. 17. <hi>Whatsoeuer yee doe in word or in deed, doe all things in the name of the Lord Iesus, giuing thankes to God, and the Father by him.</hi> The <hi>Ephesians</hi> are in like sort exhorted, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Giue thankes alwayes for all things vnto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Apostolicall exhortation to thankesgiuing foure circumstances are principally remarkeable, <hi>Quando, pro qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, cui, per quem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One is, <hi>Quando;</hi> When we are to giue thankes. We are to doe it, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Is it our dutie?

               <p>I pervse the Catalogue of the Nations, whom the <hi>Lord</hi> hath cast out before <hi>Israell.</hi> It is <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.1.

               <p>The Iesuite <hi>Pererius</hi> in his third <hi>Tome</hi> of Commentaries vpon <hi>Genesis,</hi> writing vpon the 15. Chapter, ver. 16. these words, <hi>The iniquitie of the</hi> Amorite <hi>is not yet full,</hi> moues this very doubt, but thus: The reader may here wonder, why mention is made onely of <hi>one Nation</hi> of the <hi>Amorite,</hi> sith it
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1741:109"/> is plaine by other places of holy Scripture, that there were <hi>seauen Nations,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> draue out from before the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His first answere is: It may by a <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> A part may be put for the whole; one Nation of the <hi>Amorites</hi> for all the seauen. A like <hi>Synecdoche</hi> there is, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1.4. There thus sayth the <hi>Lord</hi> vnto <hi>Ioshuah: From the wildernesse and this Lebanon, euen vnto the great riuer, the riuer</hi> Euphrates, <hi>all the land of the</hi> Hittites, <hi>and vnto the great Sea, toward the going downe of the Sunne, shall be your coast.</hi> All the land of the <hi>Hittites,</hi> shall be your coast; The <hi>Hittites</hi> onely are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and yet within the bounds described all the <hi>seauen</hi> had their habitations. It is therefore a <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> A part is put for the whole: <hi>One Nation</hi> of the <hi>Hittites</hi> for all the <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Its so here: <hi>One Nation</hi> of the <hi>Amorites</hi> for all the <hi>seauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This answere admitting a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> is approued by <hi>Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, Tremellius,</hi> and <hi>Iunius.</hi> Yet <hi>Pererius</hi> thinkes to giue a better. And therefore his second answere is: that the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> are <hi>praecipuè &amp; singulariter,</hi> chiefly and principally, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aboue all the rest, and for them all; because for the largenesse of their Nation, and for their height of stature, and for their strength of bodie, and for their excessiue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and impietie, they were aboue all, famous and much spoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercerus,</hi> that great Professor of the Hebrew tongue in the Vniuersitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> is of opinion, that the <hi>Amorite</hi> here, and else-where, is aboue all, and for all mentioned, because he of all was the most terrible, the most mighty, and the strongest.</p>
               <p>The like is affirmed by <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> that learned Spaniard; <hi>Amorrhaeum potissimùm appellat,</hi> The <hi>Amorite</hi> he especially nameth, because that Nation <hi>&amp; multitudine, &amp; copijs, at{que} potentiâ,</hi> in multitude, in forces, and in power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all the rest of the <hi>Nations,</hi> that were cast out before <hi>Israell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then, where the Lord hath sayd, <hi>Yet destroyed I the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1741:109"/> Amorite,</hi> in the <hi>Amorite</hi> we are to vnderstand also, the rest of those <hi>seauen Nations,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> draue out from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Israel:</hi> the <hi>Hittites,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Girgasites,</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and the <hi>Perezzites,</hi> and the <hi>Hivites,</hi> and the <hi>Iebusites.</hi> Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen they were in number, <hi>greater and mightier</hi> then Israell was. All seauen were cast out by the <hi>Lord</hi> from before <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:</hi> and so much are we to vnderstand by this, that the <hi>Lord</hi> here sayth, <hi>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them.</hi>

Our English, <hi>before them,</hi> hits the sense. The sense is: God stroke such a terror into those <hi>seauen Nations,</hi> the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> that at the comming of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> at the hearing of the <hi>name of Israel,</hi> they vanished, they fled away, they forsooke their auncient habitations; or else were suddenly slaine without much resistance.</p>
               <p>Thus haue you the exposition of the first branch of this ninth verse, which conteineth a generall touch of the <hi>ruine of the Amorites. Yet destroyed I the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them.]</hi> The <hi>Israelites,</hi> their vnthankefulnesse towards me is verie notorious, yet <hi>haue I destroyed the Amorite before them.</hi> Yet <hi>I]</hi> the Lord their God, who haue freed them from their bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and haue led them fortie yeares through the wildernesse, <hi>I haue destroyed]</hi> haue ouerthrowne, haue driuen out, haue brought to ruine—<hi>The Amorite]</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Amorites,</hi> but also the <hi>rest of the Nations,</hi> sixe other mightie Nations, whose dwelling was in the land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> all these haue I <hi>destroyed before them]</hi> for their sake, for <hi>Israels</hi> sake; that <hi>Israel</hi> might without resistance take quiet possession of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land that floweth with milke and honey. The lesson which we may take from hence is this:
<q>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:1741:110"/>God is all in all, either in the ouerthrow of his enemies, or in the vpholding of his children.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For further proofe hereof we may haue recourse to the 15. chapter of the Booke of <hi>Exodus.</hi> There <hi>Moses</hi> sings a song vnto the <hi>Lord,</hi> a song of thankesgiuing, wherein hee acknowledgeth the <hi>Lord</hi> to be all in all, in the ouerthrow of his enemies, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his host in the red Sea. His acknowledgment is, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in peices the enemie: In the greatnesse of thine excellencie, thou hast ouerthrowne them: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which hath consumed them as stubble. With the blast of thy nostrills the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were gathered together: the fiouds stood vpright as an heape: the depths were congealed in the heart of the Sea.</hi> The enemie feared not to enter. But thou <hi>Lord, didst blow with thy wind: the Sea couered them; they sanke as lead in the mightie waters. Who is like vnto thee, O Lord? Who is like thee? God is all in all in the ouerthrow of his enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is also all in all <hi>in the vpholding of his children. Moses</hi> in the same song auoucheth it, vers. 13. <hi>Thou, Lord, in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: Thou hast guided them in thy strength vnto thine holy habitation.</hi> It was not <hi>their</hi>

               </p>
               <p>They also who make <hi>any other creature</hi> their confidence, are here reproueable. They for their instruction may haue recourse to the 33. <hi>Psalme,</hi> at the 16. <hi>verse,</hi> thereof they may thus read: <hi>There is no King saued by the multitude of an host: a mightie man is not deliuered by much strength. An horse is a vaine thing for saftie, neither shall he deliuer any by his great strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What? Is <hi>a horse</hi> a vaine thing to saue a man? Is <hi>much strength</hi> vaine? Is there no saftie for a King <hi>in the multitude of an host?</hi> Is there no trust to be put in <hi>Princes?</hi> Nor <hi>in any man?</hi> Nor <hi>in wealth?</hi> Nor in <hi>the multitude of riches?</hi> Nor in <hi>any of the transitorie things of this world?

               <p>OF the benefits here mentioned to haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed by God vpon his people, the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> in the first place we haue the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> It is deliuered, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. Therein I propounded to your religious attentions three principall parts.</p>
               <p>In the first, we haue the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites; Yet destroyed I the</hi> Amorite <hi>before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the second, the <hi>Amorites</hi> are described. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is taken from their <hi>stature,</hi> and from their <hi>valour,</hi> each is set forth vnto vs by way of Comparison: their <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or height by the <hi>Cedars;</hi> their <hi>valour</hi> or strength by the <hi>Oke. Their height was like the height of the</hi> Cedars, <hi>and he was strong as the</hi> Okes.</p>
               <p>The third hath an explication, or an amplification of the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> It was not any gentle stripe that they receiued, not any light incision, not any small wound; but it was their extermination, their contrition, their vniuersall ouerthrow, their vtter ruine. <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>roote,</hi> Prince and people, Parents and children, old &amp; yong, were all brought to nought: <hi>Yet destroyed I their fruit from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and their roote from beneath.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:1741:112"/>
               <p>The first of these three principall parts, deliuering in a generalitie the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> was the subiect of my last discourse out of this place. Now followeth the second: the description of that people, the people of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> They are for their height or <hi>stature</hi> compared to the <hi>Cedars,</hi> and for their strength and <hi>valour</hi> to the <hi>Okes. Their height was like the height of the</hi> Cedars, <hi>&amp; he was strong as the</hi> Okes.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Their height was like the height of the <hi>Cedars.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN <hi>Syria,</hi> and especially in mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> the <hi>Cedar</hi> trees grew very high. <hi>Sennacherib</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> by his message to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> giueth testimonie hereunto. His message is, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 19.23. <hi>With the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my chariots, I am come vp to the height of the</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <hi>to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut downe the tall</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars <hi>thereof. Succidam altitudinem Cedrorum eius,</hi> so he speaketh in the <hi>Hebrew, I will cut downe the tallnesse of the</hi> Cedars <hi>of</hi> Lebanon. The words are repeated, <hi>Esa.</hi> 37.24. <hi>I will cut downe the tallnesse of the Cedars of Lebanon.</hi> The tallnesse of the <hi>Cedars]</hi> out of doubt they are very high.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> Esa. 2.13. are sayd to be <hi>subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes &amp; elevatae,</hi> high and lifted vp. In <hi>Tremellius</hi> his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, they are <hi>celsissimae &amp; elatissimae,</hi> most tall and tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Out of doubt they are very high.</p>
                  <p>If humane authoritie may be added to diuine, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus</hi> in his fift Booke of his historie of <hi>Plants,</hi> chap. 9. sayth, that the <hi>Cedar</hi> for its length or height is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, its worthie admiration. <hi>Rovillius</hi> in his Historie of <hi>Plants, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. affirmeth, that the <hi>Cedar</hi> of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> or <hi>Syria</hi> beareth a bodie streight and very tall, mounting aboue all other trees. <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> sayth as much: <hi>Cedrus vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum{que} fuerit,</hi> the <hi>Cedar</hi> wheresoeuer it groweth, it ouertop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all other trees, and is aboue all pre-eminent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous. To proue it, he bringeth those words of the spouse concerning her Beloued, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.15. <hi>His countenance is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1741:113"/> as</hi> Lebanon, <hi>excellent as the</hi> Cedars: that is, his Heroicall proceritie and the maiestie of his countenance is like vnto the <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spouse thus comparing the countenance of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, to mount <hi>Lebanon</hi> and the <hi>Cedars</hi> there, intimateth, that the encrease of the knowledge of God and his worship shall be so great, as that the open profession of Christ, for its durablenesse &amp; stabilitie, may well be likened to moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: and that the <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon</hi> doe not so much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrow other trees in tallnesse; as true Christian religion for its reuerend maiestie shall ouergoe whatsoeuer blind, bushie, and thornie superstitions.</p>
                  <p>It is out of doubt. <hi>Cedar</hi> trees are verie high. So high, that neuer man, neuer Gyant was so high. How then is it, that my text thus speaketh of the <hi>Amorites, Their height was like the height of the</hi> Cedars?</p>
                  <p>It is by a figure, which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many instances may be alledged out of holy Scripture. In the 2. of <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.23. it is said of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan, They were swifter then Eagles, they were stronger then Lyons.</hi> Swifter then <hi>Eagles,</hi> and yet the <hi>Eagle</hi> of birds is the swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test; stronger then <hi>Lyons,</hi> and yet the <hi>Lyon</hi> of Beasts is the strongest. They were <hi>swifter then Eagles,</hi> they were <hi>stronger then Lyons:</hi> they are two <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> or prouerbiall spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. By them the holy Ghost lets vs vnderstand, that <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> were exceeding swift of foot, and strong of bodie.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Psalme</hi> 107.26. it is sayd of the waues of the Sea in a great tempest; <hi>They mount vp to Heauen, they goe downe againe to the depths.</hi> They are two <hi>Hyperboles.</hi> By them the <hi>Psalmist</hi> setteth as it were before our eyes, the greatnesse of the daunger, wherein they often times are, that trade by Sea.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Genes.</hi> 13.16. The Lord said to <hi>Abram, I will make thy seede as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbred.</hi> I will make thy seede <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s the dust of the earth, <hi>saith the Lord.</hi> It is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1741:113"/> an <hi>Hyperbole. S. Austine</hi> so takes it, <hi>de Civ. Dei lib.</hi> 16. <hi>c.</hi> 21. And well. For who seeth not, how incomparably greater the number of the <hi>dust</hi> is, then the number of <hi>all the men,</hi> that euer haue bin, are, or shall be, from the first man, <hi>Adam,</hi> to the end of the world, can be? And therefore where the Lord saith, <hi>I will make thy seede as the dust of the earth;</hi> we are not to imagine that the posteritie of <hi>Abram,</hi> was to be in number as the <hi>dust</hi> (all the people of the earth put togither cannot stand in this comparison) but wee are giuen to vnderstand, that they were to be a <hi>very great people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I passe ouer with silence, many instances of like nature, and returne to my text, where it is said of the <hi>Amorites, Their height was like the height of the Cedars.</hi> The speach is prouerbiall, its hyperbolicall. We may not from it col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were as high as the <hi>Cedars,</hi> but this onely that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were a people very tall and high of stature. Neuer did any man equall the <hi>Cedars</hi> in height: yet shew me a man, that is of a vaste bodie, and of an vnusuall proceritie, I may take vp this Scripture phrase, and say of him; <hi>His height is like the height of Cedars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see the <hi>Amorites</hi> for their <hi>height</hi> or talnes are likened to the <hi>Cedar.</hi> For their strength or <hi>valour</hi> they are resembled to the <hi>Oke,</hi> in the next words:
<q>He was strong as the Okes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The figure of speach is, as before. Its prouerbiall. The <hi>Oke</hi> you know, is a hard kinde of wood, strong, firme, and durable. Hence is the prouerbe, <hi>Quercu robustior,</hi> or <hi>robore validior,</hi> stronger then the <hi>Oke.</hi> Neuer was there man of so firme a constitution, that he can properly be said to be stronger then the <hi>Oke:</hi> Yet shew me a man of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie strength, I may take vp this Scripture-phrase, and say of him, <hi>Fortis ipse quasi quercus,</hi> he is strong as the <hi>Okes.</hi> And in this sense it is here said of the <hi>Amorite,</hi> He was strong as the <hi>Okes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Amorites</hi> were of an vnusuall and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>height</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> as they are here described by our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1741:114"/> Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> you may further know by the relation which the <hi>Spies</hi> made vnto <hi>Moses</hi> after their returne from the search of the Holy land. Their relation is, <hi>Num.</hi> 13.28. <hi>The people be strong that dwell in the land; we saw the children of</hi> Anak <hi>there.</hi> At the 32. verse they speake more fully: <hi>All the people, that we saw in it, are men of great sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And there we saw the Gyants, the sonnes of</hi> Anak, <hi>which come of the Gyants, and we were in our owne sight, as grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and so were we in their sight.</hi> By this relation of the <hi>Spies</hi> you see, that the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the inhabitants of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were more, then ordinarie <hi>tall</hi> and <hi>strong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The tallest and strongest of the <hi>Amorites</hi> (of these <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> which the Lord destroyed before <hi>Israel</hi>) was <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Basan.</hi> Of his <hi>height</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> make st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ange reports. For his <hi>height</hi> they say: he was in his cradle and swadling cloutes thirty cubits high, and as he grew in yeares, so grew he in tallnesse. For his <hi>strength</hi> they say, when he had heard that the tents of the children of Israel, tooke vp the space of <hi>three miles,</hi> he rooted vp a mountaine of <hi>like space,</hi> and set it on his <hi>head,</hi> with purpose to cast it vpon the <hi>tents</hi> of Israel: but as he caried it, <hi>Ants</hi> made a hole through the midst of it, and so it descended and rested vpon his necke: whence by reason of his teeth excessiuely increasing and running into the holes of the <hi>mountaine,</hi> the <hi>mountaine</hi> stuck so fast, that he could not remoue it, to cast it, as he had purposed, vpon the campe of the Israelites. This the Iewes do write in their booke of <hi>Benedictions;</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi> in his Postill vpon <hi>Num.</hi> 21. makes mention of it: but withall censures it to be so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, that it needs no other refutation: yet he makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that we may see <hi>quanta coecitas est in Iudaeis,</hi> how blinde the Iewes are, to beleeue such fables.</p>
                  <p>It is, I grant, one of those Iewish fables, whereto <hi>S. Paul</hi> wished <hi>Titus, chap.</hi> 1.14. not to <hi>giue</hi> any <hi>heed:</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it no more, then I doe, that the Gyant <hi>Antaeus</hi> was threescore cubits high, because <hi>Gabinius</hi> in the 17. booke

So he was about <hi>three yards, two foote, and six inches</hi> high. Such an vnvsuall tallnes could not but be accompanied with strength answerable to it: and therefore <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Basan</hi> was of extraordinarie <hi>tallnes</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> If the rest of the <hi>Amorites</hi> were any thing like vnto <hi>Og,</hi> then might the relation of the <hi>Spies</hi> be iust:<note n="c" place="margin">

                     <hi>Saul,</hi> the first of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> was <hi>a choice yong man, and a goodly: there was not among the children of Israel a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier person then he: from his shoulders and vpward he was higher, then any of the people.</hi> He is so described, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.2.

                     <hi>Eliab</hi> the eldest, came first in place. Him would <hi>Samuel</hi> haue anoynted.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliab</hi> had the <hi>prerogatiue of birth:</hi> he was the first-borne sonne. Some of the <hi>prerogatiues</hi> of the <hi>first-borne</hi> sonne are couched by old <hi>Iacob</hi> in his prophecie concerning his eldest sonne, <hi>Reuben,</hi> Gen. 49.3. <hi>Reuben, thou art my first-borne, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of dignitie, and the excellencie of power. Prior in donis, maior in imperio;</hi> so the vulgar Latin concludes that verse.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:1741:115"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prior in donis]</hi> There is the first <hi>prerogatiue</hi> belonging to the eldest sonne; it concernes his profit. <hi>Prior in donis;</hi> he was first to be respected in the diuision of his Fathers inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; he was to haue a double portion of all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, according to the Commaundement, <hi>Deut,</hi> 21.17. <hi>The Father shall giue to his eldest sonne a double portion of all that he hath.</hi> The reason is annexed: <hi>For he is the beginning of his strength: the right of the first borne is his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maior in imperio]</hi> It is the second <hi>prerogatiue</hi> of the eldest sonne. It concernes his honor and state of authoritie. He had a certaine regall principalitie &amp; rule ouer his brethren. It appeareth by the blessing which <hi>Isaac</hi> bestowed vpon <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> who had gotten the birth-right from his brother <hi>Esau, Gen.</hi> 27.29. <hi>Be Lord ouer thy brethren, and let thy mothers sonnes bow downe to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Onkelos</hi> paraphrasing the prophecie of <hi>Iacob</hi> concerning <hi>Reuben,</hi> mentioneth a three-fold prerogatiue of the eldest sonne. <hi>Reuben,</hi> it was thy right to haue receiued three better portions, then thy brethren; the <hi>priest-hood,</hi> the <hi>birth right,</hi> and the <hi>kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if the eldest sonne had such <hi>prerogatiues;</hi> if he were <hi>prior in donis,</hi> and was to haue the best respect in the diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Fathers inheritance: if he were <hi>maior in imperio,</hi> and had regall principality and rule ouer his brethren, if the <hi>excellencie of dignitie,</hi> and the <hi>excellency of power</hi> were his; if his were the <hi>priest-hood,</hi> the <hi>birth-right,</hi> and the <hi>kingdome;</hi> why might not <hi>Samuel,</hi> thinke <hi>Eliab, Iesses</hi> eldest sonne, to be the man, whom the <hi>Lord</hi> had chosen to be King ouer <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> rather then a yonger brother?</p>

                  <p>Thus, what for <hi>prioritie</hi> of birth, and what for <hi>comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of person, <hi>Eliab</hi> was by <hi>Samuel</hi> thought to be the man, whom the <hi>Lord</hi> had chosen for his <hi>King</hi> among all the sons of <hi>Iesse.</hi> It seemes, <hi>Samuel</hi> thought so. For when <hi>Eliab</hi> was brought before him, he looked on him, and sayd of him: <hi>Surely the Lords annointed is before him,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6. Surely, <hi>Eliab</hi> is the man, whom the Lord hath designed to be his anointed.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Lord,</hi> the Lord <hi>who seeth not as man seeth,</hi> who <hi>respecteth not mans outward appearance,</hi> he refused <hi>Eliab.

                     <hi>wealth,</hi> nor the <hi>wise man,</hi> for his <hi>wisedome.</hi> The reason I haue alreadie touched. It is expressed, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. <hi>The Lord seeth not as man seeth. For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</hi> He looketh on the heart: and therefore he chooseth not as man chooseth, the <hi>tall,</hi> the <hi>great,</hi> the <hi>strong,</hi> the <hi>rich,</hi> the <hi>wise;</hi> but the <hi>low</hi> man, the <hi>little</hi> man, the <hi>weake</hi> man, the <hi>poore</hi> man, the <hi>foolish</hi> man. Whereto else tendeth the <hi>Apostles</hi> speech to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.26. <hi>You see your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> brethren, <hi>how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mightie, not many noble are called.</hi> But God hath chosen <hi>the foolish things of the world to confound the wise:</hi> and God hath chosen <hi>the weake things of the world, to confound the things that are mightie:</hi> and <hi>base things of the world, and things which are despised hath God chosen,</hi> yea, <hi>and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are.</hi> And what is the end of all? Its this: <hi>that no flesh should glory in the presence of God.</hi> It is the vse we are to make of the doctrine now deliuered.</p>
                  <p>We are vrged vnto it, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 9.23. There thus sayth the <hi>Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisedome, neither let the mightie man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches.</hi> But <hi>let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which exercise louing kindnesse, iudgement, and righteousnesse in the earth.</hi> In like sort say we: Let not the <hi>tall man</hi> glorie in his <hi>tallnesse,</hi> neither let the <hi>strong man</hi> glorie in his <hi>strength,</hi> though the <hi>height</hi> of the one be like the <hi>height</hi> of the <hi>Cedars,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>strong</hi> like the <hi>Okes,</hi> yet let them not <hi>glorie</hi> therein: but let them <hi>glory</hi> in this, that they <hi>vnderstand</hi> &amp; <hi>know God to be the Lord,</hi> which <hi>exerciseth louing kindnes, iudgement, and righteousnesse in the earth:</hi> that is, in the <hi>Apostles</hi> phrase, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31. <hi>He that glorieth, let him glorie in the Lord.</hi> And againe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>He that glorieth, let him glorie in the Lord.</hi> All other <hi>glorying</hi> is vaine. <hi>Glorie not</hi> in thy <hi>tallnesse;</hi> what can it auaile thee? <hi>Glory not</hi> in thy <hi>strength;</hi> it cannot helpe thee.

                  <p>A second reason, why there is such varietie of <hi>statures</hi> in the world, may be to let vs vnderstand, that a mans <hi>stature</hi> of it selfe is not to be reckoned as a part of his felicitie or glory. For if a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>goodly stature</hi> be as common, nay, more common to the <hi>wicked,</hi> then to the <hi>godly,</hi> as S. <hi>Austin</hi> seemes to proue, <hi>De Civit.

                     <hi>Tydeus corpore, animo Hercules.</hi> Its an old prouerbe. <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi> was a man of very little stature, but (as <hi>Menander</hi> the Historian sayth) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I haue stood long vpon the second part of this verse, the description of the <hi>Amorites:</hi> the time requireth, that I goe on with the third part. It is the explication, or the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, of the <hi>ruine of the Amorites.</hi> The words are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet I destroyed his fruit from aboue, and his rootes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</hi>

                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:1741:118"/>
                  <p>The words are prouerbiall, they are figuratiue, they are metaphoricall. <hi>I destroyed his fruit from aboue, and his rootes from beneath.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>exterminavi eum totum,</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Drusius.</note>
                     <hi>quantus, quantus erat:</hi> I haue wholy cast him out, I haue vtterly destroyed him.</p>
                  <p>The like phrase we meet with, <hi>Iob</hi> 18.16. Its there said of the wicked man: <hi>His rootes shall be dried vp beneath, and aboue shall his branch be cut off.</hi> The comparison stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a <hi>wicked man,</hi> and a <hi>dry tree.</hi> A <hi>dry tree</hi> may seeme to be firmely <hi>rooted,</hi> and may haue faire and wide sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>bowes,</hi> when its good for nothing, but to be <hi>cut downe</hi> and <hi>cast into the fire.</hi> So it is with the <hi>wicked man.</hi> All his pompe, all his power, all his excellencie, all his honor, all his glory (which are to him as the <hi>fruit</hi> and the <hi>rootes</hi> are vnto a <hi>tree</hi>) shall <hi>more</hi> then suffer an <hi>Eclipse,</hi> they shall <hi>vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vanish.</hi> His <hi>roots</hi> shall be dried vp <hi>beneath,</hi> and <hi>aboue</hi> shall his <hi>branches</hi> be <hi>cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot giue you an easier or plainer exposition of the Allegorie, then <hi>Bildad</hi> the <hi>Shuhite</hi> doth in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> and the verse following: <hi>His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall haue no name in the street.</hi> He shall haue no name <hi>in the street!</hi> Whats that? Its this: His old friends and acquaintance shall not so much as speake of him but to vilifie him; as to say, He was a <hi>wicked wretch,</hi> an <hi>adulterer,</hi> an <hi>vsurer,</hi> a <hi>thiefe,</hi> a <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi> a <hi>slanderer,</hi> a <hi>swearer,</hi> a <hi>blasphemer,</hi> a man, that <hi>neither feared God,</hi> nor <hi>loued his neighbour.</hi> Vpon such a man, the wicked man, <hi>Salomon</hi> hath passed his censure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.22. <hi>He shall be cut off from the earth, he shall be rooted out of it.</hi> This also may serue for an exposition of the Allegorie: <hi>His rootes shall be dried vp beneath, and aboue shall his branch be cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like Allegorie you see, is in my text: <hi>I destroyed his fruit from aboue, and his rootes from beneath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>rootes]</hi> That is, saith <hi>Lyranus, patres &amp; filios,</hi> fathers and their sonnes. <hi>Paulus de palatio</hi> by the <hi>fruit</hi> and the <hi>rootes</hi> vnderstandeth <hi>viros, mulieres, parvulos;</hi> men,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1741:119"/> women, and the litle ones. The litle ones are the <hi>fruit,</hi> men and women are the <hi>roote. Albertus Magnus</hi> will haue the <hi>fruit</hi> to be <hi>divitias, aedificia, culturam;</hi> their riches, their buildings, their husbandry; and the <hi>rootes</hi> to be, <hi>tribus, familias, &amp; successionem filiorum &amp; nepotum;</hi> their tribes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, kinreds, and the succession of their sonnes and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes. <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> takes the <hi>fruit</hi> and the <hi>rootes</hi> to signifie <hi>omnem illius gentis familiam, posteritatem{que},</hi> all the linage of that nation and their posteritie.</p>
                  <p>I passe by other like interpretations: these few may giue vs the true meaning of the words we haue in hand. The words are an explication or rather an amplification of the first part of this verse, concerning the destruction of the <hi>Amorites.</hi> There the Lord saith, <hi>I destroyed the Amorite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them:</hi> here he saith, <hi>I destroyed his fruit from aboue, and his roots from beneath.</hi> From hence we know, that it was not any gentle stripe which the <hi>Amorites</hi> receiued, not any light incisiō, not any small wound, but that it was their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,</hi> their <hi>contrition,</hi> their <hi>vniuersall ouerthrow,</hi> their <hi>vtter ruine. Fruit</hi> and <hi>root,</hi> Prince and subiect, Parents and children, old and yong, they were all destroyed. For thus saith the Lord, <hi>I destroyed their fruit from aboue, and their roote from beneath.</hi>

                  <p>Is <hi>Israel</hi> now the conqueror? Is it the sword of <hi>Israel</hi> that smiteth <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> the King
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1741:119"/> of <hi>Bashan, them,</hi> and <hi>their people,</hi> their <hi>men, women,</hi> and <hi>litle ones?</hi> How then is it, that the Lord in my text takes it to himselfe, and saith, <hi>I destroyed the Amorite,</hi> I destroyed his <hi>fruit from aboue, and his rootes from beneath?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The answer is easie. <hi>Israel</hi> indeed smote the <hi>Amorites;</hi> but it was by the power of the Lord, not by any power of their owne. <hi>Moses</hi> confesseth it of <hi>Sihon, King of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites, Deut.</hi> 2.33. <hi>The Lord our God deliuered him vnto vs, and we smote him, and his sonnes, and all his people.</hi> He confesseth it likewise of <hi>Og King of Bashan, Deut.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The Lord our God deliuered into our hands Og the King of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him vntill none was left to him remayning. Israel</hi> could not smite till God had deliuered. God first deliuered, then <hi>Israel</hi> smote. <hi>Israel</hi> smote the <hi>Amorites,</hi> not by any power <hi>of their owne:</hi> they did it by the power <hi>of the Lord.</hi> And what is done by the <hi>power of the Lord,</hi> may well be said to be done <hi>by the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In regard hereof it is, that the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 135.10. ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the victorie, whereof we now speake, immediatly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: <hi>Whatsoeuer the Lord pleased, that did he in Heauen and in Earth, in the Seas, and in all deepe places. He smote great Nations, and slew mighty Kings; Sihon King of the Amorites, and Og King of Bashan: and all the kingdomes of Canaan. And gaue their land for an heritage, euen an heritage vnto Israel his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like he doth in the next Psalme: and in the like words, <hi>Psal.</hi> 136.17. <hi>O giue thanks vnto the Lord,</hi> To him, <hi>which smote great Kings, and slew famous Kings: Sihon King of the Amorites, and Og the King of Bashan, and gaue their land for an heritage, euen for an heritage vnto Israel his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</hi> In both <hi>Psalmes</hi> you see the destruction of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morite</hi> ascribed to God himselfe, and his sole power.</p>
                  <p>So is it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.55. but more generally: The <hi>Lord!</hi> He <hi>cast out the heathen before Israel,</hi> he cast out the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> and made the <hi>Tribes of Israel to dwell in their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But no where so plainely is this great worke of casting
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1741:120"/> out the <hi>Amorites</hi> and other the heathen before <hi>Israel,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto God, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. There the people of God groning vnder their affliction in the middest of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, doe thus begin their confession, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>We haue heard with our eares, O God, our fathers haue told vs, what worke thou diddest in their dayes, in the times of old.</hi> What this worke was they expresse <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou diddest driue out the Heathen with thine hand]</hi> Thou with thy hand didst driue out the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and other the Heathen, and in their roomes didst plant our fore-fathers. This was a great worke, and it was Gods worke. That it was Gods worke and his alone, they yet further acknowledge, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>Our forefathers,</hi> they <hi>got not the land in possession by their owne sword, neither did their owne arme saue them: but thy right hand, and thine arme, and the light of thy countenance,</hi> O God, <hi>did stablish them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God was all in all in the ouerthrow of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and the rest of the Heathen. By his strength, by his might, by his power onely were they ouerthrowne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e albeit <hi>Israel</hi> smote with the sword <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Bashan, them</hi> and <hi>their people,</hi> their <hi>men,</hi> their <hi>women,</hi> and their <hi>litle ones,</hi> sith they did it onely by the strength, might, and power of the Lord, the Lord in my text doth rightly challenge the whole glory of this ouerthrow vnto himselfe; saying first, <hi>I destroyed the Amorite before them:</hi> and againe, <hi>I destroyed his fruit from aboue, and his roots from beneath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence we may take a profitable lesson. Its this,
<q>Though God vse meanes for the performance of his counsels, yet the accomplishment and glory of them, belongeth to him alone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth is so euident, that it needs no fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ther proofe. <hi>Israel,</hi> the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> they were the meanes which God vsed for the performance of his counsels vpon the <hi>Amorites,</hi> euen to destroy them, and to roote them out from being a people, but the accomplishment and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1741:120"/> of that great worke was the Lords alone. <hi>The people of Israel,</hi> had they had much ado to ouercome their enemies, the <hi>Amorites,</hi> they might happily haue imputed somewhat to their owne force. They might haue said; Shewed we not great power in the battle? Behaued we not our selues like men? Did not we fight valiantly?</p>
                  <p>But when their enemies were driuen like chaffe with the winde; when they, who earst were stour, and strong; were <hi>tall</hi> as the <hi>Cedars,</hi> and <hi>strong</hi> as the <hi>Okes;</hi> when they should extraordinarily be dismaide; should haue no more heart then a silly sheepe hath; but should be scattered at the first onset; should be so cowardly, as that their enemies might at their pleasure slay them, till they were weary of slaying them; what can be said of it? what can be thought of it? This is all. The Lord, who is Lord of battels, though he vse <hi>meanes for the performance of his counsels,</hi> and for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieving of his victories, yet will he haue the <hi>accomplishment</hi> and the <hi>glory</hi> of all to be peculiar vnto himselfe. Thus is my doctrine illustrated.</p>
                  <q>Though God vse meanes for the performance of his counsels, yet the accomplishment and glory of them belongeth to him alone.</q>
                  <p>The reason hereof is, because all <hi>power</hi> is Gods: and whatsoeuer <hi>power</hi> man hath to execute or performe what the counsell of the Lord hath appointed, its all deriued from God.</p>
                  <p>The vse is, to teach vs, to yeeld God the <hi>honor</hi> of all the <hi>victories,</hi> that he giueth vs against our enemies. The honor of <hi>all victories</hi> must be his. When I say, <hi>all victories,</hi> I meane not onely the <hi>victories</hi> of Princes, when they make warre, or winne a battell in the field, but euen our <hi>priuate victories</hi> too: as, when we haue bin assailed by some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, and are escaped from his hands; this is a <hi>victorie,</hi> and the <hi>honor of it</hi> must be the Lords.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:1741:121"/>
                  <p>If a neighbour, <hi>an vnkinde neighbour,</hi> hath done vs any wrong, or hath put vs to some trouble, &amp; we are deliuered from it, we must assure our selues, it is God that hath giuen vs the vpper hand, to the end, that we should alwaies haue our mouthes open to giue him thanks for it. This must we doe; but this is not all. We must with the <hi>mouth</hi> giue <hi>thanks</hi> to God for giuing vs the vpper hand against those that haue wrongfully molested and vexed vs; and besides, we must endeuour by our whole life to shew forth, how much we are bound to God for our deliuerance. This is the scope, this is the end of our redemption and saluation, (according to old <hi>Zacharies</hi> prophecie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.74.) that <hi>being deliuered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serue God without feare, in holinesse and righteousnes before him all the dayes of our life.</hi>

               <p>The end of both followeth in the end of the verse: <hi>To possesse the land of the Amorite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were <hi>deliuered from Egypt,</hi> and were <hi>for forty yeares protected in the wildernesse,</hi> that at length, and in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, they might <hi>possesse the land of the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are to begin with their <hi>deliuerance from Egypt.</hi> Its in the first clause of the verse:
<q>Also I brought you vp from the land of Egypt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>deliuerance</hi> of theirs out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was before the <hi>Amorites</hi> were destroyed, and yet the destruction of the <hi>Amorites</hi> is specified in the former verse. Why is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods benefits so inverted? Why is the benefit, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1741:122"/> was first collated vpon <hi>Israel,</hi> spoken of in the second place?</p>
               <p>Some thinke it was aduisedly and of purpose done, to preoccupate and preuent an obiection, which otherwise <hi>Israel</hi> might haue made. In the former verse, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. it is said, that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were destroyed, <hi>root</hi> and <hi>fruit,</hi> vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed before <hi>Israel.</hi> Now that <hi>Israel</hi> should not boast of that ouerthrow, or ascribe it to the prowesse and valour of their ancestors, <hi>their deliuerance out of Egypt</hi> is nex set downe, in this 10. verse, to put them in minde of the miserable estate and condition, wherein their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers liued in <hi>Egypt:</hi> to this sense: Thinke yee, O yee children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were destroyed by the prowesse and valour of your fore-fathers? Thinke it not. Remember <hi>Egypt.</hi> Remember how there they groaned vnder the heauy yoke of oppression, and were not able to helpe themselues, and must of necessitie haue perished, had not the Lord with his stretched-forth arme deliuered them.</p>
               <p>Others are of opinion, that this <hi>deliuerance of Israel out of Egypt,</hi> is in the second place, and after the <hi>destruction of the Amorites,</hi> set downe, onely by a custome of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Of this opinion I finde <hi>S. Hierome</hi> to be. His rule is: The Scripture in setting forth the praises of God, doth not alwayes obserue the order of the Historie: but it often comes to passe, <hi>Ʋt quae prima facta sunt, extrema dicantur, &amp; quae novissima, referantur ad prima:</hi> Things first done are last spoken of, and things last done are first recited. This he will haue vs to learne out of <hi>two Psalmes,</hi> the 78. and 105. in which <hi>signorum potentia, non ordo describitur,</hi> the power of Gods wonderfull workes, and not their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is described: and out of two other <hi>Psalmes,</hi> the 3. and 52. <hi>Vbi, quae priùs facta sunt, narrantur extrema, &amp; quae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trema, referuntur in principio:</hi> What is first done is last spoken of, and what is last done is first mentioned. The <hi>third Psalme</hi> was composed by <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he fled from
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1741:122"/>
                  <hi>Absalom,</hi> his sonne: the 52. when <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite</hi> came vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> and told him, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was come to the house of <hi>Ahimelech.</hi> That of <hi>Absalom</hi> is registred, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.14. This of <hi>Doeg,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.9. The relation of <hi>Doeg</hi> is first chronicled, and long after that, <hi>Dauids flight</hi> from <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom:</hi> &amp; yet <hi>Dauids flight</hi> frō <hi>Absalom</hi> is first mentioned in the Book of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and long after that, the relation of <hi>Doeg</hi> vnto <hi>Saul.</hi> The order of the Historie is not obserued.</p>
               <p>Nor is it obserued in this our text. The order of the Historie is: first God brought the children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12.51. He made them to passe through the middest of the <hi>red Sea,</hi> as vpon dry land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.22. And when they had finished their <hi>two and forty iourneyes,</hi> through diuers wildernesses, then gaue he them victorie ouer <hi>Sihon King of the Amorites, Num.</hi> 21.24. The <hi>Amorites</hi> were <hi>last</hi> of all destroyed, and yet are they here <hi>first</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Non est obseruatus ordo,</hi> saith <hi>Mercer;</hi> the order of the Historie is not obserued. <hi>Ribera</hi> also notes it. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurinus Quadratus</hi> here frames a rule, like to that of <hi>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Hierome, Scriptura in recensendis Dei beneficijs curiose non seruat ordinem.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> in rehearsing Gods benefits doth not curiously keepe the order, but oftentimes it falls out by a <hi>figure,</hi> which the Greekes doe call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that what was <hi>first</hi> done, is <hi>last of all</hi> rehearsed; and what was <hi>last</hi> done is <hi>first of all</hi> recited. From hence we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this conclusion:
<q>Though it be our dutie carefully to remember the manifold blessings and benefits, which God in mercy from time to time hath bestowed vpon vs; yet is it not necessarie, that we euer curiously obserue their order, and the time when they were bestowed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You see the custome of Scripture is our warrant, to speake of that <hi>first,</hi> which was <hi>last</hi> done for vs; and of that <hi>last,</hi> which we <hi>first</hi> receiued. But, <hi>first</hi> or <hi>last,</hi> we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all.</p>
               <p>Hereto belongeth holy <hi>Dauids</hi> admonition, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.2. which he there proposeth vnder the forme of an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1741:123"/> He exhorteth himselfe to blesse the Lord: <hi>Blesse the Lord, ô my soule, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> Forget not <hi>all</hi> his benefits! Nay: <hi>Forget</hi> not any of <hi>his benefits.</hi> So much the Hebrew phrase intendeth. <hi>Blesse the Lord, ô my soule, and forget not</hi> any <hi>of his benefits.</hi> A necessarie admonition. We forget nothing sooner then a <hi>benefit,</hi> whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it from God or man. But <hi>iniuriarum tenacissima est memoria;</hi> our memorie for iniuries, is very tenacious; its a hold-fast. Let an <hi>iniurie</hi> be done vs, we will not forget it. Yea let one of vs bestow vpon another any <hi>benefit,</hi> be it ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer so litle, the knowledg whereof should not be imparted from the right hand to the left, as our Sauiour Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his Sermon vpon the Mount, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.3. how long, how long will we reteine the memorie of it? Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! its corrupt. Our disposition! its peruerse. Who seeth not, what neede there is, that we exercise our selues in reteyning the memorie of Gods benefits? Wherefore let euery one of vs stirre vp himselfe to so holy an exercise, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did himselfe: Let vs daily sing vnto our soules: <hi>Blesse the Lord, ô my soule, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not <hi>All!</hi> Nay; Forget not <hi>any</hi> of his benefits. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them all, either first, or last.</p>
               <p>Now from the non-obseruance of the order of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie in this enumeration of Gods benefits vpon Israel, we are particularly to speake of the benefit mentioned in the second place. It is their deliuerance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The words are,

                  </note> S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in an Epistle of his to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biola,</hi> reporteth out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> writers, that in very same night the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> all the Temples of <hi>Egypt</hi> were ouerthrowne, <hi>siue terrae motu, sine iactu fulminum;</hi> either with earth quakes, or thunderbolts. These <hi>Hebrew</hi> writers say further, <hi>eâdem nocte lignea idola putrefacta fuisse, metallica resoluta &amp; fusa, lapidea comminuta:</hi> that in the same night all the <hi>wooden</hi> Images were rotten, all the <hi>mettall</hi> Images were dissolued and moulten, all the <hi>stone</hi> Images were broken. If so it were, it was doubtlesse a great worke, a great iudgement of God vpon those <hi>Egyptian</hi> monsters.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Esay</hi> 19.1. their confusion is againe foretold. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>the Lord rideth vpon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt, and the Idoles of Egypt shall moue at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</hi> Where the <hi>Idoles of Egypt</hi> are the <hi>heart of Egypt.</hi> They are called the <hi>heart of Egypt;</hi> because the <hi>heart</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did wholy depend vpon them, for reliefe and succour. <hi>The Lord rideth vpon a swift cloud and shall come into Egypt: and the Idoles of Egypt shall moue at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</hi> The <hi>Idols</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> shall moue and melt at the presence of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Ierem.</hi> 43.13. their desolation is likewise denounced. There the <hi>Lord</hi> threatneth to send <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> the K. of <hi>Babylon,</hi> his seruant into <hi>Egypt.</hi> What shall he doe there? <hi>He shall breake the Images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the houses of the Gods of the</hi> Egyptians <hi>shall be burnt with fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you see it confirmed not onely by Christian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and others, but also, by the sacred volumes of holy Scripture; that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were a <hi>superstitious</hi> and an <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous people.</hi>

               <p>We are not yet out of the <hi>wildernesse</hi> of <hi>Etham.</hi> For from the <hi>Red Sea, Israel</hi> went three dayes iourney in the <hi>wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of <hi>Etham,</hi> and pitched in <hi>Marah.</hi> The storie is so, <hi>Num.</hi> 33.8. In the 15. of <hi>Exodus, vers.</hi> 22. it seemeth to be called the <hi>wildernesse</hi> of <hi>Shur.</hi> For there you may thus read: <hi>Moses brought Israell from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wildernesse of</hi> Shur, <hi>and they went three dayes iourney in the wildernesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence many thinke this <hi>wildernesse of Shur,</hi> to be the same with the <hi>wildernesse of Etham.</hi> Some will haue <hi>Etham</hi> to be the generall name of the whole wildernesse, and <hi>Shur</hi> onely a part of it. Others will haue <hi>Shur</hi> to be the generall name of the whole wildernesse, and <hi>Etham</hi> onely a part of it. But neither can be so. The wildernesse of <hi>Shur,</hi> and the wildernesse of <hi>Etham</hi> are not the same: they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together diuerse. The wildernesse of <hi>Etham</hi> was a part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as hath alreadie beene shewed: the wildernes of <hi>Shur</hi> was not a part of <hi>Egypt:</hi> therefore the wildernes of <hi>Etham,</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:1741:129"/> and the wildernesse of <hi>Shur</hi> were not the same.</p>
               <p>That the wildernesse <hi>Shur</hi> was no part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the first of <hi>Samuel, Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. where I read, that <hi>Shur is ouer against Egypt.</hi> Its <hi>ouer against Egypt;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no part of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The like collection I make from the 25. of <hi>Genesis, ver.</hi> 18. there I find, that <hi>Shur is before Egypt, as a man goeth to Assyria.</hi> Its before <hi>Egypt;</hi> therefore not in <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor any part of <hi>Egypt:</hi> therefore <hi>Shur</hi> is not <hi>Etham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then doth <hi>Moses</hi> in the places now alledged, seeme to make <hi>Shur</hi> and <hi>Etham</hi> all one? I answere, if wee rightly vnderstand <hi>Moses, Moses</hi> doth not make them all one. The words of <hi>Moses</hi> I thus explicate: <hi>Moses</hi> brought <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> that they might goe forward into the <hi>wildernes of Shur:</hi> but before they came thither, they spent <hi>three daies iourney</hi> in the <hi>wildernesse of Etham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We haue almost lost our selues in these two wildernesses, <hi>Etham,</hi> and <hi>Shur.</hi> We must make more hast through the rest. I will not much more then name them. The next wildernesse they came vnto was the wildernesse of<note n="l" place="margin">

               <p>You haue now heard of many <hi>wildernesses.</hi> They are all conteined in the wildernesse mentioned in my text: <hi>I led you through the wildernesse.</hi> The <hi>wildernesse.</hi> Not the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Etham</hi> onely; but the wildernesse of <hi>Shur</hi> too, and the wildernesse of <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>all other the wildernesses,</hi> through which the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> trauailed in their way to the land of promise.

<q>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:1741:130"/>I led you through the wildernesse.</q>

               </p>
               <p>Let it be our comfort. God neuer forsakes his people. When he hath led them through one <hi>wildernesse,</hi> he will lead them through a <hi>second,</hi> through a <hi>third,</hi> through <hi>all:</hi> He will neuer leaue them, till he see them safely arriued in the place, where they wish to be.

                  <p>If so: then when we are in any distresse, and haue not speedie deliuerance according to our desires, we must waite the Lords leasure, and must expect with <hi>patience</hi> till the time come, which is appointed by him for our <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife.</hi> We must euer trust our God on his bare word: we must do it with <hi>hope,</hi> besides <hi>hope,</hi> aboue <hi>hope,</hi> against <hi>hope.</hi> For the small matters of this life we must wholy relie vpon him. How shall we hope to trust in him <hi>for greater matters,</hi> for <hi>impossibilities,</hi> if we trust him not for <hi>smaller matters,</hi> for <hi>probabilities.</hi> How can I depend on God for raysing <hi>my bodie</hi> from the graue, and for <hi>sauing my soule</hi> from Hell, if I will distrust him for a <hi>morsell of bread</hi> towards my preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lord,</hi> who brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and led them <hi>fortie yeares</hi> through the <hi>wildernesse,</hi> to possesse the <hi>land of

                     <p>And I raised vp of your sonnes for Prophets, and of your yong men for <hi>Nazarites.</hi> Is it not euen thus, O yee children of Israel, saith the Lord?</p>

               <p>THe blessings and benefits which <hi>Amos</hi> in this Chapter remembreth to haue beene bestowed by Almightie <hi>God</hi> vpon his people, the ten tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> are partly <hi>Corporall,</hi> and partly <hi>Spirituall.</hi> Of their <hi>Corporall</hi> benefits I haue heretofore in your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring discoursed in my two former Sermons. They were the <hi>destruction of the</hi> Amorites <hi>before them,</hi> and <hi>for their sake, vers.</hi> 9. their <hi>deliuerance out of</hi> Egypt, their <hi>protection and preseruation in the wildernesse for fortie yeares,</hi> to the end that they might at length <hi>possesse the land of the</hi> Amorite, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. These were notable <hi>benefits,</hi> though they were but <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> But the <hi>benefit,</hi> whereof I am now to speake, is <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> It is the doctrine of the sincere worship of <hi>God,</hi> and of eternall saluation, together with the free vse and passage thereof: or if you will, it is the ordinary ministery of the <hi>Word,</hi> thus expressed, <hi>vers.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I raised vp of your sonnes for Prophets, and of your yong men for Nazarites, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these words I commend vnto you two generall parts. One is, A <hi>description</hi> of the now mentioned <hi>Spirituall</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: <hi>I raised vp of your sonnes for Prophets, and of your yong men for Nazarites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is, A <hi>testification,</hi> that such a benefit was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed; <hi>Is it not euen thus, ô ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:1741:133"/>
               <p>In the <hi>description</hi> we may note:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Quis:</hi> Who was the bestower of this benefit, <hi>I,</hi> the <hi>Lord.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Quomodo:</hi> How it was bestowed; by a raising vp. <hi>I raised vp.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Quid:</hi> What was bestowed: <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. <hi>Quibus auxilijs;</hi> what helpe was vsed; No stranger, no forrainer had here ought to doe: they were their owne <hi>sonnes,</hi> and their owne <hi>yong men,</hi> that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. <hi>I raised vp of your sonnes, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>testification</hi> followeth: you may also call it an <hi>asseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Its set downe in the forme of a <hi>question:</hi> where you may obserue, <hi>who</hi> moues the question, <hi>to whom</hi> it is moued, and <hi>what</hi> the question is. The <hi>Lord</hi> is he, that moues the question; the <hi>children of Israel</hi> are they, <hi>to whom</hi> it is moued: the <hi>question</hi> is, <hi>Is it not euen thus? Is it not euen thus, O ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, sayth the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the diuision of my text. I might handle each part precisely: but that happily would seeme ouer-curious. I make choise therfore, to applie my selfe, after my old and wonted fashion, to fit an exposition to the words, as here they are conueyed vnto vs, by the ministery of <hi>Amos:</hi> and this with all breuitie and plainnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I] I,</hi> the <hi>Lord. I,</hi> who destroyed the <hi>Amorite</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and for your sake; <hi>I,</hi> who brought you vp from the land of <hi>Egypt, I,</hi> who for fortie yeares together led you through the wildernesse, that you might possesse the land of the <hi>Amorites; I,</hi> who thus blessed you with <hi>corporall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions, haue not beene wanting to you in <hi>Spirituall; I</hi> also <hi>raised vp of your sonnes for Prophets,</hi> and <hi>of your yong men for Nazarites.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Prophets]</hi> Such, as should, not onely preach my will vnto you, and instruct you in the way of righteousnes, but also admonish you, and fore-tell you, what was to come to passe in future times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prophets]</hi> I read in the old <hi>Testament</hi> of two sorts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Some were taught in <hi>Schooles</hi> vnder the discipline of other <hi>Prophets;</hi> who were heretofore called <hi>Filij Propheta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> sonnes of the <hi>Prophets.</hi> They are so called, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.1. &amp; 6.1. Others had their calling immediately from <hi>God,</hi> and were by him extraordinarily inspired with gifts from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1741:134"/> and so were sent forth to the exercise of their holy function. Of both these <hi>Amos chap.</hi> 7.14. maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There he saith vnto <hi>Amaziah: I</hi> was <hi>no Prophet,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>I a Prophets sonne,</hi> but <hi>I was an heardman, and a gatherer of Sycomore fruit.</hi> This he speaketh of himselfe, as he was before his calling. <hi>I was no Prophet,</hi> immediately called of <hi>God;</hi> nor was <hi>I the sonne of a Prophet;</hi> I was not trained vp or taught in any of the Schooles of the <hi>Prophets:</hi> but I was an <hi>heardman,</hi> and <hi>a gatherer of Sycomore fruit.</hi> He had no other calling, till the <hi>Lord</hi> was pleased to aduance him to the dignitie and office of a <hi>Prophet:</hi> and then was his calling extraordinarie. <hi>Amos</hi> tels, how it was, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. <hi>The Lord tooke me as I followed the flocke, and the Lord said vnto me, Goe prophecie vnto my people Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prophets</hi> mentioned in my text, may be of both sorts: such as had their institution in the Schooles of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and such as were called of <hi>God</hi> immediately and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily. <hi>God</hi> was the raiser vp of both. Yet especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Prophets</hi> here, I vnderstand, such as had their calling of <hi>God</hi> immediate, and extraordinarie. And these were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their holy function sundrie wayes: as, by <hi>dreames,</hi> by <hi>visions,</hi> by <hi>inspiration</hi> of the holy Spirit, by <hi>expresse word,</hi> vttered by some <hi>Angell</hi> representing <hi>God;</hi> and by <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, speaking to them face to face.</p>
               <p>That they were fitted to their <hi>Propheticall</hi> function by <hi>dreames</hi> and <hi>visions.</hi> We know by, <hi>Num.</hi> 12.6. where the <hi>Lord</hi> thus speaketh vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to <hi>Miriam: Heare now my words. If there be a</hi> Prophet <hi>among you, I the Lord will make my selfe knowne vnto him in a vision, and will speake vnto him in a dreame.</hi> We know it likewise by <hi>Elihues</hi> words vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 33.14. <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d speaketh once, yea twice, yet man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth it not. In a dreame, in a vision of the night, when deepe sleepe falleth vpon men, in slumbrings vpon the bed: Then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth the eares of men, and sealeth their instruction.</hi> It may also be gathered out of the euen-now cited place of <hi>Ioel, chap.</hi> 2.28. <hi>I will powre of my Spirit vpon all flesh, and your sonnes and your daughters shall prophecie, your old men shall
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1741:134"/> dreame dreames, your yong men shall see visions.</hi> Dreames and visions, you see, were meanes by which Almightie <hi>God</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his <hi>Prophets</hi> to the exercise of their holy function.</p>
               <p>They were likewise fitted thereunto, by <hi>the inspiration of the holy Ghost.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> sayth it, <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. vers. 21. <hi>Holy men of God in old time spake, as they were mooued by the holy Ghost.</hi> So were they, by <hi>the expresse word of some</hi> Angell <hi>representing God;</hi> as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.13. There shall you find two <hi>Angels</hi> instructing <hi>Lot</hi> concerning the ouerthrow of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And sometime they were enabled to their holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by <hi>God</hi> himselfe, speaking to them <hi>face to face.</hi> So was <hi>Moses.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> spake vnto <hi>Moses face to face,</hi> as a man speaketh vnto his friend. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11.</p>
               <p>Now whether <hi>Prophets</hi> of old time, were enabled to the exercise of their sacred function by <hi>God</hi> himselfe, speaking vnto them <hi>face to face,</hi> or by the <hi>apparition</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting <hi>God,</hi> or by the <hi>inspiration</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> or by <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> or by <hi>dreames,</hi> it was out of doubt a great blessing vnto <hi>Israel,</hi> to haue <hi>Prophets</hi> sent vnto them: and therefore saith the <hi>Lord</hi> vnto them, <hi>I raised vp of your sonnes for Prophets.</hi> It followeth,
<q>And of your yong men for Nazarites.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of your yong men]</hi> It is emphatically spoken. For though <hi>yong men</hi> for the most part are addicted vnto plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, yet did <hi>God</hi> raise vp of them, some, that should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themselues from the pleasures of this world, either for a time, or for euer; and these were called <hi>Nazirites; Naziraei.</hi> They were called <hi>Nazaraei, quasi Separatitij,</hi> saith <hi>Mercer;</hi> as <hi>Separatists,</hi> or men <hi>separated</hi> from <hi>wine,</hi> and vulgar delights, that they might the more freely apply their wits and studies to the law of God and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nazarites] Nazarai:</hi> They are so called by the author of the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> and so almost by all the <hi>Ancient,</hi> and by many <hi>moderne</hi> interpreters, by <hi>Benedictus, Castalio,</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> by <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> in their <hi>Bible</hi> printed by <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi> at <hi>Francford A.

               <p>
                  <hi>I raised vp of your sonnes for Prophets, and of your yong men for Nazirites.] Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Nazirites.</hi> Some haue put this difference betweene them: that the <hi>Prophets</hi> indeed taught the people the law of God, and withall foretold things to come: whereas the <hi>Nazirites</hi> did only teach the law. Be it so or otherwise; the meaning of my text is this. <hi>God</hi> would haue the ministerie of his word to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, and perpetuall, among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and for that end, he gaue them <hi>Prophets</hi> of their sonnes, men of riper yeares; and <hi>Nazirites</hi> of their yong men, who were to be trained vp in Scholes among them, there to be fitted for the holy ministerie. Such is the blessing (and it is a very great one) which is here mentioned to haue bin bestowed by the Lord vpon Israel. It is (as I said in the beginning of this exercise) it is the doctrine of the sincere worship of God, and of eternall saluation, togither with the free vse and passage thereof: or, if you will, it is the ordinarie ministerie of the word. The doctrine which hence I would commend vnto you, I deliuer in this position;

               </p>
               <p>Thus haue I prooued vnto you, that the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is the word of <hi>Saluation,</hi> as well because it is the <hi>power of God vnto Saluation,</hi> as also because it teacheth vs of the author of our <hi>Saluation.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, it is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi> The <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is called the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>peace,</hi> because the ministers of the <hi>Gospell</hi> do publish and preach <hi>Peace.</hi> This <hi>Peace</hi> which they publish and preach is threefold: Betweene

               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:1741:138"/>
               <p>First, they preach <hi>Peace</hi> betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man:</hi> that <hi>Peace,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath procured vs by the <hi>blood of his Crosse, Coloss.</hi> 1.20. In which respect he is called <hi>our Peace, Ephes.</hi> 2.14. For in <hi>him</hi> hath <hi>God</hi> reconciled <hi>vs vnto himselfe,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they preach <hi>Peace</hi> betweene <hi>man</hi> and <hi>man.</hi> They exhort you with the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>If it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as much as lyeth in you, haue peace with all men,</hi> and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Be of one minde, liue in Peace.</hi> Liue in <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> shall be with you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they preach <hi>peace</hi> betweene <hi>man</hi> and <hi>himselfe:</hi> betweene <hi>man</hi> and his <hi>owne conscience.</hi> It is that <hi>Peace,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we read, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.165. <hi>Great Peace haue they which loue thy Law, O Lord, and nothing shall offend them;</hi> they shall haue no stumbling blocke laid in their wayes: though outwardly they be assaulted by aduersitie, crosses and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yet within they are quiet: they haue the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi> they are at <hi>Peace</hi> with themselues.</p>
               <p>From this threefold <hi>peace</hi> published and preached by the ministers of the <hi>Gospell of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Gospell of Christ</hi> may well be called, <hi>the doctrine of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the doctrine of <hi>good things.</hi> The <hi>Gospell of Christ</hi> is called the <hi>doctrine of good things.</hi> Of <hi>good things!</hi> The name of <hi>Gospell</hi> in the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue imports as much. The Greekes call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the word signifieth a <hi>good message,</hi> that is, a happy, and a ioyfull message of <hi>good things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What else I pray you is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that, which you call the <hi>Gospell,</hi> but a celestiall doctrine, which God first reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Paradice, afterward published by the <hi>Patriarches</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> shadowed out in <hi>sacrifices</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and last of all accomplished by his only begotten <hi>Sonne? God</hi> who is onely <hi>good,</hi> yea, is <hi>goodnes</hi> it selfe, is the author of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Gospell</hi> must needs bring with it a message of <hi>good things.</hi> The message it bringeth is this; that mankinde is redeemed by the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Messias</hi> and <hi>Sauiour,</hi> in whom
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1741:139"/> is promised and preached to all that truly beleeue in <hi>him,</hi> perfect deliuerance from <hi>sinne, death,</hi> and the <hi>euerlasting curse.</hi> Could there be any more happy or welcom tidings to mankinde, then this was? Out of doubt the <hi>Gospell of Christ</hi> is the <hi>doctrine of good things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is the <hi>doctrine of the Kingdome.</hi> The <hi>Gospell of Christ</hi> is the <hi>doctrine of the Kingdome.</hi> Its so called, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.43. where <hi>Christ</hi> saith of himselfe, <hi>I must preach the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to other Cities also.</hi> So is it, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.14. there the <hi>Euangelist</hi> saith of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he preached the <hi>kingdom of God</hi> in <hi>Galilee.</hi> This <hi>Kingdome</hi> is twofold; of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of <hi>Glory:</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> here on earth, and of <hi>glory</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in Heauen. Of <hi>grace</hi> here: here <hi>Christ</hi> reigneth in the soules of the faithfull by his word and holy Spirit. Of <hi>glory</hi> hereafter, when <hi>Christ</hi> shall haue deliuered vp the <hi>Kingdome</hi> to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> speaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24.</p>
               <p>If so it be: if the <hi>Gospell of Christ</hi> be the <hi>word of Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> if it be the <hi>doctrine of Peace,</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> betweene <hi>man</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> betweene <hi>man</hi> and <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:</hi> if it be the <hi>doctrine of good things,</hi> of our deliuerance from <hi>sinne,</hi> from <hi>death,</hi> and from the <hi>curse of the Law:</hi> if it be the <hi>doctrine of the Kingdome;</hi> the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>glory.</hi> then must it be granted, that the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospell</hi> do bring with them blessings of an inestimable value. And such is my doctrine;
<q>The ministerie of the word of God freely exercised in any nation, is to that nation a blessing of an inestimable value.</q>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e vse hereof concerneth the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and their auditors. First, the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> They may here be put in minde of their dutie, which is willingly and cheerefully to preach the <hi>Gospell.</hi> This their dutie may be called a <hi>debt. S. Paul</hi> calls it so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14, 15. <hi>I am deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor both to the Grecians and to the Barbarians, both to the wise men, and to the vnwise. Therefore as much as in me is, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to preach the Gospell to you also that are at Rome. S. Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:1741:139"/> (you see) acknowledgeth a <hi>debt,</hi> and makes a conscience of discharging it. The obligation or bond whereby he was made a <hi>debter</hi> was his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> calling: his <hi>debt</hi> was, to <hi>preach the Gospell:</hi> the persons to whom he was <hi>indebted,</hi> were <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> the <hi>wise</hi> and the <hi>vnwise.</hi> His good conscience to discharge his debt, appeareth in his readinesse to doe it: <hi>I am ready, as much as in me is, to preach the Gospell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Paul</hi> may be vnto vs a patterne of imitation. We also must acknowledge a <hi>debt,</hi> and must make a <hi>conscience</hi> of discharging it. The obligation or bond whereby we are made <hi>debtors</hi> is our <hi>ministeriall</hi> calling. Our <hi>debt</hi> is, to <hi>preach the Gospell.</hi> The persons to whom we are indebted, are <hi>our owne flocke,</hi> our owne people, the people ouer whom the Lord hath made vs ouer-seers. Our good <hi>conscience</hi> to discharge our debt will appeare in our readinesse to doe it. I, and euery other <hi>minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospell</hi> must say, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth, <hi>I am ready, as much as in me is, to preach the Gospell</hi> to you. So farre forth as God shall permit and make way for discharge, <hi>I am ready to preach the Gospell</hi> to you. Nothing hath hitherto, or shall hereafter with hold me from paying you this <hi>debt,</hi> but onely the impediments which the Lord obiecteth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the vse of my doctrine concerneth <hi>you,</hi> who are the <hi>hearers</hi> of the <hi>word.</hi> You also may here be put in minde of your dutie, which is patiently and attentiuely to <hi>heare</hi> the word preached. Of your readinesse in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe I should not doubt, if you would but remember what an vnvaluable treasure it is, which we bring vnto you.

Is it not your <hi>peace</hi> inward, and outward, your <hi>peace</hi> with God, your <hi>peace</hi> with man, your <hi>peace</hi> with your owne consciences? Is it not the <hi>doctrine of good things,</hi> your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from sinne, from death, and from the curse of the Law?

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1741:140"/> euen thus? Can it be denyed?</p>
               <p>Beloued in the Lord, the Lord who raised vp vnto the ten Tribes of Israel of their <hi>sonnes</hi> for <hi>Prophets,</hi> and of their <hi>yong men</hi> for <hi>Nazarites,</hi> he raiseth vp vnto you of your sonnes <hi>Ministers, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi> and of your <hi>yong men,</hi> such as may be trayned vp and fitted in the Scholes of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> in our <hi>Naioths,</hi> in our <hi>Ʋniuersities</hi> for a present supply, when God shall be pleased to remoue from you, those which haue laboured among you, and are ouer you in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Its an admirable and a gracious dispensation from God, to speake vnto man, not in his <hi>owne person,</hi> and by the voice of his<note n="k" place="margin">

                  <hi>thunderings</hi> and <hi>lightnings,</hi> or with the noyse of a <hi>trumpet,</hi> as he did vpon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> when he gaue the <hi>Law</hi> (for then should we runne away, and cry vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> or some other seruant of God, <hi>Speake thou with vs, and we will heare: but let not God speake with vs, lest we dye</hi>) but by <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Pastors,</hi> and other <hi>Ministers,</hi> men of our own nature, flesh of our flesh, &amp; bones of our bones, men subiect to the same<note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>passions,</hi> whereto <hi>we</hi> are. Admirable and gracious is this dispensation.</p>
               <p>God thus borrowing, and vsing the tongues of men to speake vnto men, doth it <hi>quasi imperans, non quasi mendicans,</hi> (as <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh <hi>Serm.</hi> 5. vpon the <hi>Canticles</hi>) he doth it not <hi>begging,</hi> but <hi>commanding:</hi> and in that he doth it, <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia est, non indigentia;</hi> it is not from any want in himselfe, but it is from his <hi>indulgence</hi> and fauour vnto vs: and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>non efficaciam quaerit, sed congruentiam,</hi> he seekes not any strength to his owne words, but congruence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our infirmities? Its euen so. For we were not able to beare the glory of that <hi>Maiestie,</hi> if it did not in some sort hide and temper it selfe vnder these earthly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</p>
               <p>Now therefore when we take the counsels of <hi>God</hi> from the lips of our <hi>sonnes,</hi> and of our <hi>yong men,</hi> from the lips of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> from the lips of the <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>isters</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we may say of them, as the men of <hi>Listra</hi> once said of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1741:140"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> but renouncing the idolatry of the speach, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.11. <hi>God is come downe to vs in the likenesse of men. God</hi> is he that speaketh from aboue, that blesseth and curseth, that bindeth and looseth, that exhorteth and dehorteth by the mouth of his <hi>Ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this respect and relations sake betweene <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Ministers,</hi> whom it hath pleased him to dignifie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in some sort with the representation of his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vpon earth, they haue euer heretofore bin holden in very reuerend estimation. Such was the estimation hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>S. Paul</hi> by the <hi>Galatians. S. Paul</hi> himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15. where he beares them record, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit through <hi>infirmitie of the flesh,</hi> he preached the <hi>Gospell</hi> vnto them at the first, yet they <hi>despised</hi> him <hi>not, nor reiected</hi> him, but <hi>receiued</hi> him as an <hi>Angell</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> euen as <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi> yea, that if it had bin possible (Nature and the Law forbidding it) they would haue <hi>plucked out</hi> their owne <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>giuen them</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>But why speake I of the reuerend regard giuen to <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> or to any other the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the word of God in the primitiue times of the Church? Looke ye but to the dayes of late, to the dayes of your Fathers; and you will see them in very high esteeme. Then, though your Priests, were but <hi>Lignei sacerdotes,</hi> wooden priests, priests of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> that were your leaders and your guides, you highly honoured them. You bestowed vpon them your <hi>eareings,</hi> and your <hi>frontlets,</hi> your lands and reuenewes to maintaine them in their <hi>Couents,</hi> and <hi>Cloysters.</hi> To euery <hi>Fryer</hi> that drew you aside to confesse you, you submitted your selues, with <hi>Pater meus es tu,</hi> you are my <hi>Father,</hi> my <hi>ghostly Father.</hi> So farre were you from <hi>despising</hi> or <hi>reiecting</hi> them, that yee <hi>receiued</hi> them as <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yea as <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Such honour had the <hi>Priests</hi> in your fore-fathers dayes.</p>
               <p>No maruaile, will some say. For then <hi>Religion</hi> had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vp <hi>Policie,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> had deuoured the <hi>Common-wealth, Cloysters</hi> were richer in treasure, then <hi>Kings houses,</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:1741:141"/> all the wealth &amp; fatnes of the Land was swallowed downe into the bellies of <hi>Frieryes</hi> and <hi>Noneryes.</hi> No maruaile if then <hi>Priests</hi> were held in high esteeme. But now the times are changed, and we with them.</p>
               <p>True, I grant: the times are changed indeed. For as a worthy <hi>Prelat</hi> yet liuing <hi>(Lect.</hi> 34. <hi>in Ionam)</hi> speaketh: Now <hi>Policie</hi> hath eaten vp <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>men</hi> rob <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> expostulateth, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Men rob God</hi> against all equitie and conscience. But wherein doe they rob him? In <hi>tithes</hi> and <hi>offerings.</hi> His <hi>tithes</hi> and <hi>offerings</hi> are translated to <hi>strangers:</hi> they eat the materiall bread of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who neuer giue them spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall foode: and they that serue not at the <hi>Altar,</hi> do liue by it: whereas many a <hi>Minister,</hi> that serueth at the <hi>Altar,</hi> hath not whereon to liue. Hence is the <hi>Ministerie</hi> growne into contempt; and they who should be honoured for their <hi>calling sake,</hi> are for their <hi>wants sake</hi> very basely thought of.</p>
               <p>I speake not this to taxe you of this place: you <hi>rob not God,</hi> but do duely pay your <hi>tithes</hi> and <hi>offerings;</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> here hath its right; and euer may it haue to your comfort. But I do it to moue you to lift vp your hearts to the throne of grace, and to blesse the Lord, for as much as when the <hi>tythes</hi> and <hi>offerings</hi> of some of your <hi>neighbour Villages</hi> are made <hi>appropriate,</hi> yours are by Gods goodnes exempted from the <hi>spoyle,</hi> and reserued to their <hi>proper vse:</hi> whereby you may in all ages be prouided, though not of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Nazirites,</hi> such as God raised vp vnto <hi>Israel,</hi> but of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> such as may be able to breake vnto you the <hi>bread of life,</hi> and to preach vnto you the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Saluation,</hi> the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>good things,</hi> and the <hi>Gospell</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome of God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Lord is he, that moues the <hi>question,</hi> the <hi>children of Israel</hi> are they to whom the question is moued: the <hi>question</hi> is, <hi>Is it not euen thus? Is it not euen thus, ô ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither the time, nor your patience will giue way to the seuerall handling of these particulars: nor is there any neede of enlargment, the words are so plaine and without obscuritie. The <hi>question</hi> is vehement, it vrgeth the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> it calls their consciences to witnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it not euen thus, ô ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Say, O ye <hi>children of Israel;</hi> haue I not done so and so for you? Haue I not bestowed such and such <hi>benefits</hi> vpon you? Can any of you denie it? <hi>Vti{que} nemo,</hi> saith <hi>Rupertus:</hi> ther's none of you can be so impudent as to denie it. <hi>I,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> who destroyed the <hi>Amorite</hi> before you and for your sake; I, who brought you vp out of the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and led you <hi>forty yeares</hi> through the wildernesse, to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the land of the <hi>Amorites; I,</hi> euen <hi>I,</hi> also raised vp of your <hi>sonnes</hi> for <hi>Prophets,</hi> and of your <hi>yong men</hi> for <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. Is it not euen thus, O yee children of Israel? I,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> aske you the question, <hi>Is it not thus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The points of doctrine from hence to be collected are diuers;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God</hi> will haue the <hi>blessings</hi> and <hi>benefits</hi> which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth vpon vs, euer to be had <hi>in remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We must acknowledge, that whatsoeuer <hi>good</hi> we haue, we haue it from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>blessings</hi> which God bestoweth vpon vs, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to those he bestowed vpon the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I make this plaine by a briefe collation of the blessings bestowed by the Lord vpon them and vs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord</hi> brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the <hi>house of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi>

               <p>IN this propheticall Sermon written by <hi>Amos</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Israelites,</hi> I haue heretofore in my eight Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon this Chapter, obserued foure principall parts;
<list>
                     <item>A <hi>Reprehension.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>An <hi>Enumeration.</hi>

                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, a <hi>reproofe</hi> of <hi>Israell</hi> for sinne, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.7.8.</p>
               <p>The second, a <hi>recitall</hi> of the benefits which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon <hi>Israel,</hi> vers. 9.10.11.</p>
               <p>The third, a <hi>twyting</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> with their vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The fourth, a <hi>threatning</hi> of <hi>punishment</hi> to befall them, from the 13. <hi>verse,</hi> to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Of the two former, the <hi>Reprehension</hi> and the <hi>Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> you haue at sundry times alreadie heard. Now are we to proceed to the <hi>Exprobation,</hi> conteined in the words at this time read vnto you.</p>
               <p>For our easier vnderstanding whereof, we are to cast backe an eye vpon those <hi>benefits</hi> which in the precedent verses are mentioned to haue beene bestowed by the <hi>Lord</hi> vpon his people <hi>Israel.</hi> They were either <hi>Corporall</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1741:143"/> Corporall,</hi> as the <hi>destruction</hi> of the <hi>Amorites</hi> before the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and for their sakes, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. their <hi>deliuerance</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their protection and preseruation in the <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse</hi> for <hi>fortie yeares</hi> together, that at length they might possesse the land of the <hi>Amorite, vers.</hi> 10. And <hi>Spirituall,</hi> as the doctrine of the sincere <hi>worship</hi> of God, and of eternall saluation, together with the free vse and passage thereof, expressed, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. by the raising vp of their <hi>sonnes</hi> for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> and of their <hi>yong men</hi> for <hi>Nazirites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were very great <hi>benefits,</hi> and worthy all thankfull acknowledgement. But the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> were so farre from giuing thankes for them, that they<note n="a" place="margin">Ruffinus.</note> vilely esteemed them, and too too contemptuously reiected them. This appeareth in this 12. <hi>verse,</hi> which I therefore call an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration,</hi> an <hi>vpbraiding,</hi> or <hi>twyting</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> with the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their<note n="b" place="margin">Albertus Magnus.</note> ingratitude. Two things here are laid vnto their charge: one is, Their <hi>solliciting</hi> the <hi>Nazirites</hi> to breake their vow. The other is their <hi>hindering</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> in the execution of their function. The first in these words, <hi>yee gaue</hi> the Nazirites <hi>wine to drinke.</hi> The second in these, <hi>yee commaunded the</hi> Prophets, <hi>saying</hi> Prophecie not. Of these in their order.</p>
               <p>The first is, their <hi>solliciting</hi> the <hi>Nazirites to breake their vow: Ye gaue the</hi> Nazarites <hi>wine to drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the name of <hi>Nazirites,</hi> and of their institution, I spake in my last exercise out of this place. I will not now spend time vpon the repetition of that, I then deliuered. It shall suffice, if I adde but a word or two for the further illustration thereof.</p>
               <p>The<note n="c" place="margin">Babington in Num. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Nazirites</hi> had their name of <hi>Nazar,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to <hi>separate.</hi> They were yong men, <hi>separate</hi> from the ordinarie course of men, and bound to a certaine peculiar course and profession of life. They were <hi>Ecclesiae ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> sayth<note n="d" place="margin">Harmon. in <hi>4</hi> lib. Moses.</note>
                  <hi>Calvin, ornaments of the Church,</hi> and God would in them, as in a glasse make his honor and glorie in some sort to appeare. They were, <hi>quasi pretiosae gemmae,</hi> to shine as rich Iewels among the people of God. They were, <hi>tanquam
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1741:143"/> signiferi, antesignani, &amp; duces,</hi> as standard-bearers, ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and chiefetaines to shew the way of diuine worship vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others.</p>
               <p>Singular was the honor and dignitie of this order and calling of <hi>Nazirites. Ieremie</hi> in his <hi>Lamentations chap.</hi> 4.7. thus sets them forth. <hi>Her</hi> Nazirites <hi>were purer then snow, they were whiter then milke, they were more ruddie in body then Rubies, they were like polished Saphyres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The author of this order and calling is <hi>God.</hi> This appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the verse next before my text. There the <hi>Lord</hi> hath sayd, <hi>I haue raised vp of your yong men for Nazirites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first branch of the <hi>Law,</hi> that concerneth this order and calling is accurately described, <hi>Num,</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Whosoeuer shall vow the vow of a</hi> Nazirite, <hi>he shall absteine from wine and strong drinke, he shall drinke no vineger of wine, or vineger of strong drinke, neither shall he drinke any liquor of grapes, nor eate moist grapes nor dried. All the dayes of his</hi> Naziriteship <hi>shall he eate nothing that is made of the vine tree from the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels euen to the huske.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Nazirites</hi> for the time of their <hi>Naziriteship</hi> were to apply themselues wholy to the studie of the law of God, and therfore was abstinence from <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>strong drinke</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned them. God would haue them refraine all things that might trouble the <hi>braine,</hi> stirre vp <hi>lust,</hi> and make them vnfitly disposed for so holy a <hi>studie:</hi> of which sort are <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>strong drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> so accounts of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.1. For there he saith, <hi>Wine is a mocker, strong drinke is raging, and whosoeuer is deceiued thereby is not wise. Salomons</hi> Mother doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise so account of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.4. There her counsaile to her sonne is: <hi>It is not for Kings,</hi> O <hi>Lemuel,</hi> it is not for Kings to <hi>drinke wine, nor for Princes to drinke strong drinke: lest they being drunken, forget the Law, and peruert the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of the afflicted.</hi> For this cause also were the <hi>Priests</hi> forbidden <hi>wine,</hi> when they were to goe into the tabernacle of the Congregation, and that vpon paine of death. The prohibition is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.9. There thus saith the <hi>Lord</hi> to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1741:144"/>
                  <hi>Aaron; Doe not drinke wine, nor strong drinke, thou nor thy sonnes with thee, when yee goe into the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, lest ye die. It shall be a statute for euer throughout your generations.</hi> Hitherto I referre that, <hi>Exech.</hi> 44.21. <hi>No priest shall drinke wine, when he entereth into the inner court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the places now alledged ariseth this position:
<q>Sobrietie is a vertue fit for all men, but especially for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the word and Sacraments. <hi>Especially for</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</q> The reasons are:</p>
               <p>First, it is not for <hi>Ministers</hi> to speake foolishly, or to doe any thing vndecently. Yet can they not but offend both in the one and the other, if they suffer themselues to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with swilling of <hi>wine</hi> or <hi>strong drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is for <hi>Ministers,</hi> to be vigilant in their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to be diligent in their ministeriall imployments, in reading, in studie, in meditation, to be deuout in their praiers vnto God for themselues &amp; the people, ouer whom God hath made them ouerseers; to handle the word of life reuerently, and to dispense it in due season to euery weary soule. Yet must they needs faile in the performance of these duties, if they giue themselues to the drinking of <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>strong drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here may all that serue at the <hi>Altar</hi> be admonished, euermore to be mindfull of their calling, and of the hatred which God hath of excesse in men deuouted to his seruice, aboue all others; as also of the fearefull iudgement, that will in the end without all faile ensue. For if of all it be true, that the <hi>drunkard</hi> shal neuer enter <hi>into the kingdome of God</hi> (which you know to be true, and the holy Spirit hath passed it for a truth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.) then must it needs be sealed vp in the conscience of any <hi>Minister,</hi> that a <hi>Minister</hi> through his excesse in <hi>drinking</hi> causing the holy things of God to be despised, shall <hi>neuer, neuer</hi> come within the gates, of that eternall ioy, but in stead thereof shall reape the reward of his sinne in euerlasting torments, both of bodie and soule. But this by the way.</p>
               <p>The thing wherewith the <hi>Israelites</hi> in my text stand
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1741:144"/> charged, is, their giuing the <hi>Nazirites</hi> wine to drinke. The <hi>Israelites</hi> knew full well, that it was the peremptorie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and expresse commandement of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Nazirites</hi> should absteine from <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>strong drinke:</hi> yet did they contrary thereunto giue vnto the <hi>Nazirites</hi> wine to drinke.</p>
               <p>Gaue they the <hi>Nazirites</hi> wine to drinke? was this such an offence, that God should take displeasure at it? To what end then serues the precept of giuing <hi>wine</hi> to him, that is readie to perish through the anxietie and bitternesse of his minde, that thereby he may be cheared and comforted? The precept is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.6. <hi>Giue strong drinke vnto him that is readie to perish, and wine vnto those that be of heauie hearts. Let him drinke, and forget his pouertie, and remember his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery no more.</hi> In vaine were this precept, were the drinking of <hi>wine</hi> an offence, whereat <hi>God</hi> should take displeasure. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth amisse, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. to wish him <hi>to drinke no longer water,</hi> but <hi>to vse a little wine for his stomackes sake, and his often infirmities;</hi> if the drinking of wine be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. If the drinking of <hi>wine</hi> be an offence, why doth the same Apostle tell the <hi>Romans, chap.</hi> 14.17. that <hi>the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God consisteth not in meate and drinke,</hi> thereby giuing them libertie, not onely to <hi>eate,</hi> but also to <hi>drinke</hi> what they would, euen to drinke wine?</p>
               <p>To this I say: It is not of it selfe any offence <hi>to drinke wine,</hi> or to giue others <hi>wine to drinke;</hi> but herein consisteth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they gaue the <hi>Nazirites wine to drinke</hi> contrary to the Law of God, and his holy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. <hi>Tolle verbum Domini, et liberum est vinum bibere: adde verbum Domini, &amp; vinum exhibere aut bibere, tam gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de est nefas, quàm adulterium aut latrocinium.</hi> So <hi>Brentius.</hi> Let there be no law, no commandement of God against <hi>the drinking of wine,</hi> and you may at your pleasure <hi>drinke wine:</hi> But if Gods law and commaundement be against it, then for a man to <hi>drinke wine</hi> himselfe, or to giue others <hi>wine to drinke,</hi> its as great a sinne, as <hi>adulterie,</hi> or <hi>robbery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise had a law giuen him, that hee should
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:1741:145"/> not eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euill. The law is expressed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Of the tree of knowledge of good and euill thou shalt not eate of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.</hi> To eate an Apple was of it selfe but a small matter; but the <hi>Law of God,</hi> whereby the eating of the Apple was forbidden, was a matter of great weight. The very <hi>eating of the Apple</hi> God did not much care for: it was the obseruance of his commandement, and the obedience thereunto, that he required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> had a commandement giuen him, that he should goe downe to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and tarry there seauen dayes, till <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> should come, and direct him what to doe. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is expressed, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Thou shalt goe downe before me to</hi> Gilgal, <hi>and behold, I will come downe vnto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seauen dayes shalt thou tarrie, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt doe.</hi> According to this commandement, <hi>Saul</hi> went to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and tarried there<note n="e" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.8.</note>
                  <hi>seauen dayes</hi> according to the set time that <hi>Samuel</hi> had appoynted. The seauenth day a little before <hi>Samuel</hi> came, <hi>Saul</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 9.</note> offered a burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>Thy kingdome shall not continue.</hi> The offering of the <hi>Holocauste</hi> or <hi>burnt offering</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> was it not of it selfe a good worke? Yet because <hi>Saul</hi> offered it out of due time, namely before <hi>Samuel</hi> was come, it was sinne vnto him, and the losse of his <hi>kingdome.</hi> Did the <hi>Lord</hi> care for the preoccupation, or preuention of so little time, as if it were a matter of it selfe to be regarded? No: it was the <hi>obseruance</hi> of his commandement, and the obedience thereunto, that he required.</p>
               <p>So for my text I say: <hi>The giuing the Nazirites wine to drinke,</hi> was not of it selfe a matter that the <hi>Lord</hi> much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1741:145"/> but it was the <hi>obseruance</hi> of his commaundement, and the <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto, that he required. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement I euen now repeated vnto you out of <hi>Num.</hi> 6. The summe of it is, The <hi>Nazarite</hi> shall absteine <hi>from wine and strong drinke.</hi> Contrary to this commandement, did the <hi>Israelites</hi> here giue vnto the <hi>Nazarites</hi> wine to drink: which is the thing, wherewith they are here twyted, to this sense: <hi>Ye gaue the Nazarites wine to drinke:</hi> in so doing you made proofe of your contempt of my Law, and your disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto. I looked you should haue beene thankefull vnto mee, for bestowing so great a benefit vpon you, as is the order and calling of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> for the trayning vp of your yong men in pietie and religion: but you, <hi>vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full you,</hi> haue repaid me with contempt, and disobedience, you haue sollicited the <hi>Nazarites</hi> to breake their vow and contrary to my Law, <hi>yee gaue them wine to drinke.</hi> The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we are to gather from hence, is,
<q>Disobedience against Gods holy lawes and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, is a sinne, carefully to be eschewed by euery child of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As by the knowledge of <hi>light</hi> we may know what <hi>darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> is, and by the knowledge of <hi>good</hi> what <hi>euill</hi> is, so by the knowledge of <hi>obedience</hi> towards God, we may know what <hi>disobedience</hi> against him is. Of <hi>obedience</hi> towards God I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in my fift Lecture vpon this Chapter. I then hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this conclusion. <hi>Obedience to the commandements of the Lord, is a dutie, which the Lord requireth to be performed by euery child of his.</hi> Whence by the Law of contraries fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth my now conclusion;
<q>Disobedience against the commandements of the Lord, is a sinne, which the Lord requireth to be eschewed by euery child of his.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the illustration of this conclusion we are to note in man a twofold <hi>disobedience;</hi> one in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> the other in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>regeneration. Disobedience</hi> in man in the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1741:146"/>
                  <hi>state</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> is an euill qualitie inbred in him by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby he is made of himselfe altogether vnable and vnwilling to liue in subiection vnto God, to heare his voice to obey his will, or to doe what he commandeth. By this disobedience man is not able to doe any thing, but <hi>hate</hi> God, his word, his will, and whatsoeuer is pleasing to him. He euer rebels against God, he euer resisteth the will of God, he euer despiseth the commandements of God, and embraceth with all his might what God forbiddeth.</p>
               <p>How great this <hi>disobedience</hi> is, the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> doth euidently demonstrate, when it describeth the nature of man, his thoughts, his counsailes, his affections, his desires, his actions in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> and before his <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> So it calls vs<note n="k" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Such is the <hi>disobedience</hi> that is in man, while he is in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>corruption</hi> before he is <hi>regenerate.</hi> There is another kind of <hi>disobedience</hi> in man, when he is in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>disobedience</hi> is common to euery child of God, while he liueth in this world, albeit in some it be <hi>greater,</hi> in some <hi>lesse,</hi> as <hi>regeneration</hi> is <hi>perfecter</hi> in some, then in others. This I thus describe: <hi>disobedience</hi> in man in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is an euil qualitie inbred in him by nature, wherby he is made vnable to yeeld due subiection vnto God wholy on
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1741:146"/> euery part, with all his heart, and all his might, or, <hi>so to obey</hi> his holy will simply in all things, and alwayes without <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuersation,</hi> as neuer to decline from the rule of true <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this <hi>disobedience</hi> we are all made guiltie of the wrath of God, of damnation, and of eternall death. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hereof made <hi>Dauid</hi> Psal. 130.3. to crie out vnto the <hi>Lord: If thou, Lord, shouldest marke iniquities: O Lord, who shall stand?</hi> It drew from him that humble supplication, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>O Lord, Enter not into iudgement with thy seruant: for in thy sight shall no man liuing be iustified.</hi> It wrested from him that same confession, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.6 namely, that the very godly, haue need to pray for the <hi>remission</hi> of their sinnes. There speaking of the <hi>remission</hi> of sinnes he saith; <hi>For this shall euery one that is godly pray vnto thee.</hi> For <hi>this,</hi> for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes,</hi> shall euery one that is godly pray vnto thee, O <hi>Lord.</hi> From hence is it, that our blessed <hi>Lord, and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iesus Christ</hi> taught his Apostles, the most perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that euer were, and therefore the most godly, to pray <hi>for remission of their sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This disobedience, which as yet resideth in vs, in the best of vs, S. <hi>Paul</hi> elegantly describeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. where thus he speaketh in his owne person as a man regenerate: <hi>we know that the law is spirituall: but I am carnall, sold vnder sin.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, and diuerse of late, as <hi>Erasmus, Ochinus, Castellio, Faustus, Socinus</hi> the <hi>Samosatenian, Iacobus Arminius,</hi> and their adherents doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh these words, not of himselfe, as a man <hi>regenerate,</hi> but doth in them describe a man that

               </p>
               <p>This their opinion is erroneous.

<q>Disobedience against Gods holy lawes and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a sinne, which the Lord requireth to be eschewed by euery child of his.</q>
               </p>

                  <hi>Disobedience,</hi> not onely that, which is in euery man that is yet in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> but that other too, which is incident to the truely <hi>regenerate,</hi> is a <hi>sinne</hi> carefully to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed by euery child of God. <hi>Euery child of God</hi> should be vnwilling to displease God: and what can more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him then <hi>disobedience?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Disobedience!</hi> Gods <hi>curse</hi> is vpon it. The <hi>curse</hi> is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119 21. <hi>Maledicti, qui declinant amandatis tuis;</hi> cursed are they that doe erre from thy commaundements. <hi>Maledicti, a Deo scilicet, Cursed</hi> of God are all they, of what estate or condition soeuer they are, that doe erre, in their life and conuersation, from his commaundements, which he hath prescribed as footsteps and paths for men to tread in. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> are they that <hi>doe erre,</hi> he saith not, they that <hi>haue erred;</hi> for they that <hi>haue erred,</hi> may <hi>haue repented;</hi> but <hi>cursed</hi> are they that <hi>doe erre</hi> from thy commaundements.</p>

I then obserued in the words a double ouersight in the <hi>Israelites:</hi> the first was, that <hi>they solicited the Nazirites to breake their vow;</hi> the second, that <hi>they hindred the Prophets in the execution of their holy function.</hi> The first in these words, <hi>Yee gaue the Nazirites wine to drinke:</hi> The second in these, <hi>Yee commanded the Prophets, saying, Prophesie not.</hi> Of the first then. Now of the second.</p>
               <p>My method shall be first, to take a view of the words: then, to examine the matter conteined in them. The words are,
<q>Yee commanded the Prophets, saying, Prophesie not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yee commanded <gap reason="foreign">

So shall the words sound thus: You, vnthankfull <hi>Israelites,</hi> you to whom <hi>I haue raised vp of your sonnes for Prophets,</hi> you haue taken vpon you authoritie ouer my <hi>Prophets,</hi> to forbid them to <hi>prophesie</hi> in my name, and to

                  <hi>The Prophets]</hi> What <hi>Prophets?</hi> We are to distinguish betwixt the <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuarie,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboams priests:</hi> betweene <hi>Starres</hi> in the right hand of <hi>Christ,</hi> fixed in their stations, and <hi>planets</hi> of an vncertaine motion; betweene <hi>shepheards</hi> and <hi>hirelings.</hi> There was an <hi>Aaron,</hi> and there was an <hi>Abiram;</hi> there was a <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> and there was a <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> there was a <hi>Iude,</hi> and there was a <hi>Iudas.</hi> Not euery one that calls himselfe a <hi>Prophet,</hi> is by and by a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi> for euen the woman <hi>Iezebel calleth herselfe a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse, Revel.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Baal</hi> had his <hi>foure hundred and fiftie</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; not one of them a true Prophet; all of them against <hi>Elias,</hi> the Prophet of the Lord, 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.22. <hi>Ahab</hi> had his <hi>foure hundred</hi> Prophets; not one of them a true Prophet; all of them against <hi>Micaiah,</hi> the Prophet of the Lord, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22 6.</p>
               <p>Against such intruders, seducers and lying Prophets we are armed with an admonition from the Lord, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23.16. There <hi>thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Hearken not vnto the words of the Prophets, that prophesie vnto you; they make you
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1741:153"/> vaine: they speake a vision of their owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.</hi> In this ranke of seducers and lying Prophets, I place those vpholders of the <hi>man of sinne, Priests</hi> &amp; <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who from the <hi>Seminaries</hi> beyond the Seas come ouer hither into this our Country, here to sowe the seeds of disloyaltie and blinde superstition in the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>God hath not sent</hi> them, <hi>yet they runne; God hath not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them,</hi> yet they prophecie: as <hi>Ieremie</hi> speaketh of the false Prophets in his dayes, <hi>chap.</hi> 23.21. <hi>They prophecie lyes</hi> in the Lords name, and cry, <hi>I haue dreamed, I haue drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, vers.</hi> 25.</p>

I answer in the words of <hi>Ieremie, chap.</hi> 14.14. <hi>They prophecie vnto you a false vision, a divination, a thing of naught, and the deceit of their owne hearts.</hi> Their sweet tongues vtter vnto you as deadly poyson, as is<note n="a" place="margin">

No <hi>peace,</hi> either to the <hi>weale publicke,</hi> or to the <hi>priuate conscience</hi> of any man. Not to the <hi>weale publicke:</hi> for, their <hi>conspiracies</hi> are nefarious and bloody. Not to the <hi>priuate conscience</hi> of any man: for, to be reconciled to that <hi>vnsound Church</hi> of theirs, the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to partake of their <hi>formall,</hi> and <hi>counterfeit absolution</hi> of sinnes, to heare and see their <hi>histrionicall Masses,</hi> to visit the <hi>shrines</hi> &amp; <hi>reliques of the dead,</hi> to say a number of <hi>Pater-Nosters,</hi> or <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> vpon beads, to invocate <hi>Saints,</hi> to adore <hi>Images;</hi> can these, or any such <hi>forgeries</hi> yeeld any <hi>peace</hi> to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed conscience?

Mine hand shall be vpon</hi> you; yee <hi>shall not be in the assembly of my people,</hi> yee shall not <hi>be written in the writing of the house of Israel;</hi> ye shall not <hi>enter into the land of Israel.</hi> A heauy sentence! Will you haue the plaine meaning of it?

               <p>You haue heard in generall of Prophets, <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false.</hi> I should now speake somewhat more distinctly.</p>
               <p>There are two sorts of <hi>false Prophets:</hi> Some haue <hi>no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> at all; some haue <hi>a calling,</hi> but without efficacie. Of the first sort were these Priests in <hi>Iudah,</hi> who were neither <hi>chosen by man,</hi> nor <hi>called of God;</hi> of whom the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth <hi>Ierem.</hi> 14 14.<note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ierem.</hi> 14.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.8, 9.</note>
                  <hi>I sent them not, neither haue I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them,</hi> neither <hi>spake I vnto them,</hi> yet <hi>they prophecie:</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:1741:154"/> and <hi>chap.</hi> 23.21. <hi>I sent them not, yet they ranne, I spake not to them, yet they prophecied.</hi> Of the second sort, were those Prophets in <hi>Israel,</hi> whom <hi>men chose,</hi> but <hi>God called not.</hi> Of such some would haue these words, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.8. to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, <hi>The Prophet is the snare of a fowler in all his wayes, and hatred in the house of his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In opposition to these, there are of <hi>true Prophets</hi> two sorts also. Both of them are <hi>lawfully</hi> called to their holy fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; some by <hi>God</hi> alone, some by <hi>God and man.</hi> The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Prophets</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and the blessed <hi>Apostles</hi> in the <hi>New,</hi> had their calling from <hi>God</hi> alone: but <hi>Timothie, Titus,</hi> and the seauen <hi>Deacons,</hi> and the residue of religious and godly <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church, had and haue their calling, both from <hi>God and man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This distinction thus giuen, it is now easie to define, who the <hi>Prophets</hi> are, that are meant in my text. They are <hi>true Prophets,</hi> such as had their calling immediatly <hi>from God,</hi> and <hi>from him alone:</hi> euen those <hi>holy men of God,</hi> who liued in the time of the <hi>old Testament;</hi> some of which had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be the blessed pen-men thereof. Such were the <hi>Prophets,</hi> whom the <hi>Israelites commanded, saying, Prophecie not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prophecie not]</hi> Speake not any more vnto vs in the name of the Lord. What? No more! Can there be any one so execrably audacious, as vtterly to forbid the passage of the <hi>word of God?</hi> any forhead so brasen, as simply and precisely to <hi>reiect it?</hi> Its not to be imagined. The most wicked dare not doe it. Yet would they by their wills haue lesse libertie of speach permitted to <hi>Gods Prophets,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and seruants: they would haue their tongues some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tied, that they might not by their crying out against sins, vex and gall their seared consciences.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we haue taken a view of the words. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that we examine the matter conteined in them.</p>
               <q>Yee commanded the Prophets, saying, Prophecie not.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hoc nimirum erat,</hi> saith <hi>Rupertus, non solum loqui, sed etiam agere contra Spiritum Sanctum, qui loquebatur per os Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum:</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:1741:154"/> This indeed were not onely to <hi>speake against,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>to doe against</hi> the holy Ghost, who <hi>spake by the mouth of the Prophets.</hi> He noteth the disordered and franticke hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that was in the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> to vilifie and neglect those <hi>Prophets</hi> and teachers, which the <hi>Lord</hi> out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of his mercie had sent vnto them, to be their guides and directors in the way of true pietie and religion. The lesson we are to take from hence, I giue in this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<q>The wicked are euermore in a readinesse to doe all the disgrace and despite they can to the true Prophets of the Lord, and his Ministers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This truth grounded vpon my text, and thereby suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently warranted, may further be illustrated by other places of this volume of the Booke of God.</p>
               <p>In the seauenth Chapter of this <hi>Prophecie</hi> we see what course entertainment our Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> receiueth from <hi>Amaziah,</hi> a Priest of <hi>Bethel.</hi> He there forbids <hi>Amos</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie any more in the kingdome of the <hi>tenne Tribes;</hi> and aduiseth him to get him away by flight to the kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> where the Lords prophets were better welcome and more regarded: and tells him that in <hi>Israel,</hi> they needed no such Prophets, nor cared for them, nor would suffer them to preach so plainely to their King <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> Will you haue <hi>Amaziahs</hi> owne words vnto <hi>Amos?</hi> They are in the <hi>twelfth</hi> and <hi>thirteenth</hi> verses. <hi>O thou Seer</hi> (for he that is now<note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam</hi> 9 9.</note> called a <hi>Prophet,</hi> was before time called a <hi>Seer) O thou</hi> Seer, <hi>goe, flee thee away into the land of</hi> Iudah, <hi>and there eate bread, and</hi> Prophecie <hi>there. But</hi> Prophecie not <hi>againe any more at</hi> Bethel: <hi>For it is the Kings Chappell, and it is the kings Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was the entertainement, of the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> found in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> any whit better? Not a whit. In the 18. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Prophecie, <hi>vers.</hi> 18 I find the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against him. <hi>Come,</hi> say they, <hi>let vs deuise deuises against Ieremiah: Come, and let vs smite him with the tongue, and let vs not giue heed to any of his words.</hi> In the 20. Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1741:155"/> I find him <hi>smitten and put in the stockes by Pashur, the chiefe gouernor of the Lords house.</hi> In the 26. Chapter, <hi>vers,</hi> 8.

                  <hi>For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as sheepe appoynted for the slaughter.</hi> And thus you see what is the portion of <hi>Gods</hi> Ministers vnder the <hi>new Testament.</hi> Vnder both <hi>New,</hi> and <hi>Old,</hi> they are liable to the disgraces and vexations of this wicked world. So true is my proposition.</p>
               <q>The wicked are euermore in a readinesse, to doe all the disgrace and dispite they can to the true Prophets of the Lord, and his Ministers.</q>
               <p>Yet not to them onely, not onely to the <hi>true Prophets of the Lord,</hi> and his <hi>ministers;</hi> but to you also of the <hi>laitie,</hi> to as many of you, as haue a true desire <hi>to liue in the feare of God,</hi> and <hi>to die in his fauour:</hi> to as many of you, as are willing to <hi>deny vngodlinesse</hi> and <hi>worldly</hi> lusts, that yee may liue<note n="x" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>You must put on the <hi>Liuery</hi> and <hi>cognisance</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as well as wee. The most principall and royall <hi>garment,</hi> which he wore, while he liued vpon the earth, was <hi>affliction.

                     <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.17.</note> sonnes of <hi>Thunder, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> would needs be aduanced in the Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> to sit, the one on his <hi>right hand,</hi> the other, on his <hi>left.</hi> But what doth <hi>Christ?</hi> Doth he graunt their request? He doth it not. He thus speakes vnto them:<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 20 22. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.38.</note>
                  <hi>Are ye able to drinke of the cup, that I shall drinke of, and to be baptized with the baptisme, that I am baptized with?</hi> Vpon their answere which is affirmatiue, <hi>we are able, Christ</hi> farther saith vnto them, <hi>ye shall indeed drinke of the cup, that I drinke of, and with the baptisme that I am baptised with, shall ye be baptised.</hi> But <hi>to sit on my right hand,</hi> and <hi>on my left hand, is not mine to giue, but</hi> it shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>to them for whom it is prepared.</hi> It is as if <hi>Christ</hi> had said in fewer words, ye must of necessitie <hi>beare the Crosse,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee can <hi>weare the Crowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will say; <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were of the number of the <hi>twelue Apostles;</hi> and that they indeed by their calling were to <hi>take vp their crosse,</hi> and <hi>to follow Christ:</hi> but what is that to vs? to vs, who are not of the ranke? who are not <hi>Prophets?</hi> nor <hi>Apostles,</hi> nor <hi>Ministers?</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> shall answere you for me, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>All that will liue godly in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, shall suffer persecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus haue you my doctrine enlarged: <hi>The wicked are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore in a readinesse, to doe all the disgrace and despite they can, not onely to the true Prophets of the Lord, and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:1741:156"/> but also to the true seruants of God, of what vocation, estate, or condition soeuer they be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs a little examine the reason why the <hi>wicked</hi> should stand thus affected towards the <hi>godly.</hi> The reason is, because they hate the Godly. <hi>They hate the Godly:</hi> and therefore will they doe them <hi>all the disgrace and despite they can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wicked <hi>hate the Godly.</hi> It is no new thing: Its no rare thing. <hi>No new</hi> thing; for<note n="b" place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Physition</hi> that binds a <hi>franticke</hi> man, if he be bitten by him, <hi>non reputat magnum,</hi> he counts it not any <hi>great</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but excuseth his patient for his frensies sake.

               <p>Nor is it <hi>Novum,</hi> nor is it <hi>Rarum;</hi> its neither <hi>new,</hi> nor <hi>rare,</hi> as you haue alreadie heard. Its no <hi>great</hi> matter, nor is it any <hi>new</hi> thing, or <hi>rare</hi> that the world should <hi>hate you,</hi>

               <p>Now if there can be no <hi>fellowship,</hi> if no <hi>communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and the world;</hi> can we looke there should be any fellowship, any communion, betweene <hi>Saints</hi> &amp; <hi>worldlings,</hi> betweene the <hi>godly,</hi> and the <hi>wicked,</hi> betweene such as <hi>loue God,</hi> and such as <hi>loue the world?</hi> If there be <hi>no concord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> can we expect there should be any concord betweene <hi>true Christians</hi> and <hi>Belialists,</hi> betweene the <hi>followers of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>sonnes of Belial?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be expected. These, whom I call <hi>Belialists</hi> or the <hi>sonnes of Beliall, worldlings</hi> and the <hi>wicked,</hi> are such as <hi>loue the world:</hi> the other, whom I call <hi>true Christians,</hi> or <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Christ, Saints,</hi> &amp; the <hi>godly,</hi> are such as <hi>loue God.</hi> The

               <p>Will it now please you to collect with me? the qualities of the <hi>wicked,</hi> the <hi>sonnes of Belial, worldlings,</hi> such as <hi>loue the world,</hi> are wholy repugnant and contrary to the qualities, of the <hi>Godly,</hi> the <hi>followers of Christ, Saints,</hi> such as <hi>loue God:</hi> and therefore there can be no agreement betweene them: No better then was betweene <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> And that you know was bad enough. For <hi>Cain</hi> slew <hi>Abel.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:1741:158"/> slew he him? S. <hi>Iohn</hi> giues you the reason, 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Because his owne workes were euill, and his brothers righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus farre of the <hi>hatred</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> against the <hi>Godly,</hi> the true reason of my doctrine, which was:
<q>The wicked are euermore in a readinesse, to doe all the disgrace and despite they can, not onely to the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Lord, and his Ministers, but also to the true seruants of God, of what vocation, estate, or condition soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs now make some vse of that which hath beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deliuered, for the bettering, and the amendment of our sinfull liues.</p>
               <p>First, the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Gods word, may from hence learne, not to take it vnto heart, if such, as are bound by the Law of God and nature, and by all good order, to yeeld them due loue and reuerence, shall in pride and contempt insult ouer them, to <hi>disgrace and to despite them.</hi> They may well remember, that its neither <hi>great,</hi> nor <hi>new,</hi> nor <hi>rare</hi> thing, that they meete with such course entertainement in the world; forasmuch as they cannot be ignorant, that the <hi>world hateth them.</hi> And what if the <hi>world hate them!</hi> Shall they therefore be altogether dejected? They need not. For <hi>Christ</hi> giues them encouragement and comfort, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.18. <hi>If the world hate you, yee know that it hated me before it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument is drawen <hi>ab exemplo,</hi> from Christs owne example. <hi>The world hateth mee,</hi> you know it to be so, you see it. It needes not then to be any disparagement to you if <hi>it hate you,</hi> it hated me <hi>before it hated you. Cur ergo se mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum, supra verticem extollit?</hi> S. <hi>Austine</hi> propounds the question <hi>Tract.</hi> 88. <hi>in Iohannem.</hi> Why doth a member ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll it selfe aboue the head? <hi>Recusas esse in corpore, si non vis odium mundi sustinere cum capite:</hi> thou refusest to be in the <hi>bodie,</hi> if thou wilt not with the <hi>head</hi> susteine the <hi>hatred of the world.</hi>

               <p>A second argument of encouragement and comfort to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1741:158"/> vs against the hatred of the world; is drawne from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the world, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>If ye were of the world the world would loue his owne: hut because ye are not of the world, but I haue chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> This argument is euident euen to the common sense of men; who cannot but know, that betweene contraries there is no argreement, and betweene men of vnlike qualities, no full consent of minds. It is then as if <hi>Christ</hi> had thus said: <hi>The world loues</hi> none but <hi>his owne;</hi> none but those that are addicted, deuoted, and wholy giuen ouer to it: but you <hi>are not of the world;</hi> therefore it loues not you. You <hi>are not of the world;</hi> for you are mine; and<note n="i" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>A third argument of encouragement and comfort to vs, is <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>Remember the word, that I said vnto you: The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is not greater then the Lord: if they haue persecuted me, they will also persecute you.</hi> This argument is like the first: Its drawne from <hi>Christs</hi> owne example, as that was.

               </p>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1741:159"/> vulnerato existente, milites eius sine vulnere in civitate epulantes manere,</hi> sayth <hi>Salmeron:</hi> It were very base and shamefull, for souldiers to remaine in the Citie at ease without hurt, while their <hi>King</hi> lies wounded in the Campe. <hi>Pudeat,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Bernard Serm.</hi> 5. <hi>in Festo omnium Sanct. pudeat sub spinato capite, membrum fieri delicatum:</hi> It were a shame for vs to liue deliciously and in pleasures, saith our head, <hi>Christ,</hi> was crowned with thornes.</p>
               <p>I conclude the first vse: Let the <hi>wicked</hi> fret, and fume, and stamp, and stare, and grudge, and murmure against vs, let them forbid vs to <hi>prophecie,</hi> let them refuse to <hi>heare vs,</hi> let them lay vpon vs <hi>all the disgrace and despite they can;</hi> yet will we possesse our soules in patience, knowing it to be a faithfull saying, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11.12. that, <hi>if we die with Christ, we shall also liue with him,</hi> and <hi>if we suffer with him, we shall also raigne</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>A second vse is for all other the true seruants of God, of what vocation, condition, or estate soeuer they be: for as much as the wicked lie in waite for them also, to <hi>doe them all the disgrace and despite they can,</hi> as hath already bin proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto you. The vse is to admonish you, that ye take it not to heart, if they, who are bound by the law of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> by the bond of <hi>neighbour-hood,</hi> and <hi>our Christian profession,</hi> to loue you, and to tender your good, shall in pride and contempt insult ouer you, <hi>to disgrace and to despite you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The arguments for your encouragement and comfort in such a case, may be the same with those, which I but euen now produced for the encouragement and comfort of our selues in the like: will you haue them sūmed vp vnto you? Then thus.</p>
               <p>You find but course respect and entertainement in the world, because the world <hi>hateth you.</hi> It <hi>hateth you.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile not at it, nor feare it. For first it <hi>hated</hi> Christ, before it <hi>hated you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the world <hi>would loue you,</hi> if you were <hi>his owne.</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:1741:159"/> But you are not. You <hi>are not of the world,</hi> and therefore the <hi>world hateth you.</hi> Be of good comfort: you <hi>are not of the world,</hi> for Christ hath <hi>chosen you out of the world,</hi> to be his beloued.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the world from <hi>hating</hi> you proceedeth to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute</hi> you. Let not this discourage you. For it <hi>persecuted</hi> Christ first. They haue <hi>persecuted</hi> Christ, and therefore will they <hi>persecute</hi> you.<note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>It is enough for the Disciple, that he be as his Master, and the seruant as the Lord. Christ</hi> is your <hi>Master,</hi> he is your <hi>Lord:</hi> you are his <hi>disciples,</hi> you are his <hi>seruants.</hi> Let his<note n="s" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</note> example be your rule; be it our rule too, (for herein we are all equall) be it the rule of direction to vs all; the rule of all our sufferings.<note n="t" place="margin">

                  <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not againe; when he suffered, he threatned not; but committed his cause to him, that iudgeth righteously.</hi> Here is matter worthy our imitation.</p>
               <p>The resolued <hi>Christian</hi> herevpon thus sweetly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. Shall Christ <hi>lie in the manger,</hi> and we ruffle it out <hi>in our palaces?</hi> Shall he mourne <hi>in sackcloth,</hi> and wee bath <hi>in pleasure?</hi> Shall he fighting in our defence, <hi>be wounded and crucified among theeues;</hi> and shall we <hi>disport</hi> and <hi>solace</hi> our selues with fond and vaine delights? Shall he bee <hi>pierced through</hi> with the sword of Gods iustice for our sins, and shall we be vnwilling <hi>to suffer any thing for our selues?</hi> This were too too vnnaturall and vnkinde.</p>
               <p>Let not therefore the <hi>crosse aduentures</hi> that may betide vs, dismay vs: Let not the <hi>crueltie</hi> of our enemies, the <hi>sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of our miseries, the <hi>continuance</hi> of our afflictions, daunt vs: but let vs (following the aduise of <hi>S. Peter</hi> 1. <hi>Ep. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 13.) Let vs <hi>reioyce, in as much as we are partakers of Christs sufferings.</hi> So <hi>when his glory shall be reuealed,</hi> we shall be <hi>glad also with exceeding ioy.</hi> Thus much of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond vse.</p>
               <p>A third followeth. You remember the doctrine.</p>
               <q>The wicked are euermore in a readinesse, to doe all the disgrace and despite they can, not onely to the true Prophets of the Lord and his Ministers, but also to all
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1741:160"/> other, the true seruants of God, of what vocation, estate, or condition soeuer they be.</q>
               <p>The vse is, to reproue those, who esteeme not aright of the sufferings of the godly. Let a godly man be <hi>humbled</hi> vnder the crosse, let him feele the hand of God vpon him; how will some wonder at him, as at a<note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 102.6, 7.</note>
                  <hi>Pelican of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> as at <hi>an Owle of the desert,</hi> as at <hi>a sparrow</hi> that sits <hi>alone vpon the house top?</hi> They will hold him for a great sinner, and will measure his condition by the chastisement, that he endureth.</p>
               <p>Did not <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deale so with <hi>Iob?</hi> From the <hi>afflictions,</hi> the <hi>miseries,</hi> the <hi>calamities,</hi> that <hi>Iob</hi> suffered, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that <hi>Iob</hi> is no innocent man, no righteous man, but a deepe dissembler, and a hollow-hearted hypocrite. His censure of <hi>Iob</hi> you may finde <hi>chap.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Remember I pray thee,</hi> saith <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Iob,</hi> Remember I pray thee, <hi>who euer perished being innocent?</hi> Or <hi>where were the righteous cut off?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who euer perished being innocent?</hi> Or <hi>where were the righteous cut off?</hi> It was <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his error, to collect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Iob</hi> was afflicted, and that most grieuously, that therefore he was <hi>to perish,</hi> or to be <hi>cut off vtterly.</hi> God suffereth not his elect children, such as <hi>Iob</hi> was, <hi>vtterly to perish,</hi> or <hi>to be cut off.</hi> He <hi>afflicteth</hi> them, but with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to deliuer them; his <hi>hand</hi> is sometimes vpon them, but it is for their good, not for their ruine. For albeit they may seeme to vs <hi>to perish,</hi> when in the <hi>fire</hi> of their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and trials, they are surprised by death, yet they <hi>perish not;</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> he receiues them into his glory, and to a more happy life.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his question, <hi>Who euer perished being innocent?</hi> Or <hi>where were the righteous cut off?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; If <hi>Eliphaz</hi> take the words of <hi>perishing,</hi> and <hi>cutting off,</hi> in the strict sense and properly, I answer, <hi>neuer did the innocent perish,</hi> neuer was <hi>any righteous man cut off.</hi> But if he take the words in a larger sense for <hi>wallowing in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie,</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:1741:160"/> or <hi>lying in affliction;</hi> my answer then, is the same that <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> hath <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Moral. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Saepè quippe hîc &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentes pereunt, &amp; recti funditùs delentur.</hi> Surely here in this world the <hi>innocent</hi> doe oftentimes <hi>perish,</hi> and the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> are vtterly cut off: <hi>sed tamen ad aeternam gloriam, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reundo seruantur:</hi> yet in <hi>perishing,</hi> and in <hi>being cut off,</hi> they are reserued to eternall glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Si nullus innocens periret,</hi> if no man should perish, that is innocent, why should the Prophet <hi>Esai.</hi> say, <hi>chap.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart! Si rectos, Deus providendo non raperet,</hi> if God in his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence should not take away any righteous man, why should the wise man, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.11. say, The righteous was <hi>speedily taken away,</hi> lest that <hi>wickednesse should alter his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> or <hi>deceit beguile his soule? Si iustos, animadversio nulla percuteret,</hi> if no punishment should smite the iust, why should <hi>S. Peter</hi> say, 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 4, 17. <hi>The time is, that iudgement must begin at the house of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, dearely beloued, sith it may in some sense bee truely said of the man that is <hi>innocent,</hi> that he <hi>perisheth;</hi> and of the <hi>righteous</hi> man, that he is <hi>punished,</hi> is <hi>taken away,</hi> is <hi>cut off;</hi> and of the <hi>faithfull</hi> of Gods house, that <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must begin</hi> with them: let it euer bee our care to <hi>esteeme aright</hi> of the <hi>afflictions</hi> of our neighbours, and to <hi>iudge of them,</hi> with a righteous iudgment. Though they be <hi>iudged,</hi> be <hi>plagued,</hi> be <hi>smitten</hi> of God, it is not for vs slightly to regard them, to despise them, or to hide our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from them: it is our parts rather to haue a fellow-feeling and a tender compassion of their tryals.</p>
               <p>It were an vnchristian, an vncharitable, yea a hellish conceit, thus to inferre: <hi>My neighbour,</hi> such a man, or such a man, <hi>is exercised vnder the Crosse,</hi> and is <hi>sensible of the scourge of God vpon him,</hi> therefore <hi>he is in Gods disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and a very grieuous sinner.</hi> No such inference is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in <hi>Christs schole.</hi> In his <hi>schole,</hi> these Maximes passe for good. Where <hi>God purposeth to heale, he spareth
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1741:161"/> not to launce.</hi> He ministreth <hi>bitter sirupes to purge corrupt humors:</hi> he sends embassies of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reuenge,</hi> where he meaneth to <hi>bestow eternall life.</hi> I conclude with that blessing which <hi>S. Iames chap.</hi> 1.12. bestoweth vpon the afflicted. <hi>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tryed, he shall receiue the crowne of life, which the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them that loue him.</hi>

               </epigraph>
               <p>VVE are now come to the fourth part of this first Sermon of <hi>Amos,</hi> concerning the kingdome of the <hi>tenne tribes</hi> of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> I heretofore called it a <hi>Commination.</hi> So I call it still. For here are the <hi>Israelites</hi> threatned with punishment for the enormitie of their sinnes, expressed, <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8. and for the foulenesse of their ingratitude, layd to their charge, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. In this <hi>Commination</hi> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue two things.</p>
               <p>First, how the <hi>Lord,</hi> in respect of the sinnes of <hi>Israel,</hi> and of their vnthankfulnesse for benefits bestowed on them, esteemeth of them, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>Behold, I am pressed vnder you as a Cart is pressed, that is full of sheaues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is, a menacing or threatning of punishment to befall them: I may terme it, <hi>A sending of defiance</hi> vnto them; a <hi>denouncing of warre</hi> against them, <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15, 16.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1741:162"/> Wherein we may note three things.</p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>impotentia fugiendi,</hi> their vnablenesse to escape the flight in the day of battell: thus set downe in the 14. <hi>vers. The flight shall perish from the swift.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 15. thus: <hi>He that is swift of foote, shall not deliuer himselfe: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliuer himselfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is, <hi>Debilitas in resistendo,</hi> their weakenesse in resisting the enemie thus set downe, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>The strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mightie deliuer himselfe,</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 15. thus: <hi>Neither shall he stand that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the bow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is, <hi>Fugafortium:</hi> the flight of the valiant, and stout of heart, set downe in the last verse, and there ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the adiunct of nakednesse: <hi>He that is couragious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the mightie, shall flee away naked in that day.</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the confirmation of all, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>THis particle, set in the front of this verse, is as it were a watchword to stirre vp our attentions, for as much as we are to heare of some important matter.

                  <p>First, it noteth <hi>rem novam, ac inopinatam, at{que} mirabilem:</hi> some thing that is new and vnlooked for, and wonderfull: as <hi>Act.</hi> 1.10. <hi>while</hi> the Apostles <hi>looked stedfastly toward heauen,</hi> at the time of Christs ascension, <hi>Ecce, Behold, two men,</hi> or two Angels in the forme of men, <hi>stood by them in white apparell.</hi> So it is vsed by the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> in her <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat, Luk.</hi> 1.48. <hi>Behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</hi> Where <hi>Ecce, Behold, rem magnam, novam, &amp; admiratione dignam, designat,</hi> sayth <hi>Alfonsus Salmeron. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!</hi> it designeth and poynteth out vnto vs, some great matter, new, and admirable, such as is, <hi>creaturam in lucem edere creatorem famulam Dominum generare, Virginem Deum parere.</hi> What greater, what newer, what matter more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, then that a <hi>Creature</hi> should conceiue in her wombe and bring forth her <hi>Creator,</hi> a <hi>handmaid</hi> her <hi>Lord,</hi> a <hi>virgin, God?</hi> It is so full of wonder, that the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.14. stamps it with an <hi>Ecce, Behold, Behold, a virgin shall conceiue and beare a sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Euangelist S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 1.23. reciting the Prophets prediction, leaues not out this stampe, <hi>Behold: Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who was sent from God to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> to report vnto her, this great wonder, omits not this stamp, <hi>Ecce, Behold.</hi> See the Angels words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.31. <hi>Behold, thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Iesus.</hi> This the <hi>Postillers</hi> doe call <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce admirativum,</hi> an <hi>Ecce</hi> of Admiration: and it is the first vse of the particle <hi>Behold,</hi> obserued by <hi>Lorinus.</hi>

                     <hi>Behold, behold them,</hi> or <hi>behold these things, and I will giue to</hi> Ierusalem <hi>one that bringeth good tydings.</hi> The place I vnderstand of <hi>Christ,</hi> who is <hi>Alpha,</hi> or <hi>primus,</hi> the <hi>first;</hi> and <hi>Euangelista,</hi> he that bringeth the good tydings: him God giueth to <hi>Sion,</hi> and to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in him, <hi>Ecce ecce ista erunt:</hi> Behold, <hi>behold</hi> all the promises of God shall come to passe, and that speedily.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> is a note of asseueration, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, and is put for <hi>Sanè</hi> or <hi>Certè,</hi> verily or certainly.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> is a particle, ordinarily vsed by God in his Comminations, when he threatneth some great and heauie punishment to come. as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Thus sayth the Lord</hi> against Ierusalem, <hi>Behold, I, euen I am against thee, and will execute iudgments in the midst of thee, in he sight of the Nations,</hi> And, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.3. Thus saith the <hi>Lord</hi> against <hi>Israel, Behold, I,</hi> euen <hi>I, will bring a sword vpon you, and I will destroy your high places.</hi> And against <hi>Tyrus, chap.</hi> 26.3. Behold, <hi>I am against thee,</hi> O Tyrus, <hi>and will cause many Nations to come vp against thee, as the Sea causeth hee waues to come vp.</hi> And against <hi>Zidon, chap.</hi> 28.22.

                  <p>Sufficient shall it be for you at this time to bee aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that as often as you meete with this word <hi>Ecce, Behold,</hi> in the sacred Volume of the word of God; so often you haue a <hi>watch-word,</hi> to stirre vp your attention, to listen to the matter that ensueth, for its weight and worth.

<q>Our sinnes are sometimes burdensome and grieuous vnto God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such were the sinnes of the old world, we know it by, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5, 6. For <hi>God saw, that the wickednesse of man was great in the earth, and that euery imagination of the thoughts of his heart was onely euill continually.

                  <p>Such were the sinnes of <hi>Iudah.</hi> We know it by the first Chapter of the Prophecie of <hi>Esai.</hi> The complaints which God maketh there, doe prooue it: <hi>vers.</hi> 21. <hi>How is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Citie become an Harlot?

Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of theeues: Euery one loueth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they iudge not the fatherlesse, neither doth the cause of the widow come vnto them.</hi> And verse 14. <hi>Your new moones, and your appointed feasts, my soule hateth, they are a trouble vnto me, I am weary to beare them.</hi> You see; the sins of <hi>Iudah</hi> were a trouble vnto God, he was <hi>weary to beare them.</hi> They were <hi>burdensome</hi> and <hi>grieuous</hi> vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Such were the sinnes of <hi>Israel,</hi> we know it by the 43. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Esai.</hi> There verse 24. thus saith the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Israel: Thou hast made me to serue with thy sinnes; thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</hi> What!

                  <p>Are not the sinnes of the whole world such? Are not our sinnes such? Sweet <hi>Iesus,</hi> thou knowest they are such.

                  <p>Thus haue you my doctrine, and the vses thereof. My doctrine was: <hi>Our sinnes are sometimes burdensome and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto God.</hi> My first vse was; an incitement to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of sinne in generall. My second was, a caueat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the foulest of sinnes, <hi>obstinacie</hi> and <hi>impenitencie.</hi> My doctrine branding our sinnes with burdensomenesse and grieuousnesse in respect of God; I grounded vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which in my text, God maketh against <hi>Israel; I am pressed vnder you, as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaues. God</hi> is <hi>pressed</hi> vnder our sinnes; therefore our sinnes are <hi>burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> vnto him, they are <hi>grieuous</hi> vnto him.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be questioned, how God can be said to <hi>complaine</hi> of our sinnes, to be <hi>burdened</hi> with them, to be <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi> at them, sith in himselfe he hath all pleasure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Complaints,</hi> we know, are the witnesses of a <hi>burdened,</hi> and <hi>grieued</hi> soule. God here <hi>complaineth</hi> of pressure, that he is <hi>pressed</hi> vnder Israell, <hi>as a Cart is pressed, that is full of sheaues:</hi> from whence the collection is, that the sinnes of <hi>Israel</hi> are <hi>burdensome</hi> and <hi>grieuous</hi> vnto God. But can this be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? Can our <hi>sinnes</hi> be <hi>burdensome</hi> vnto God? Can they be <hi>grieuous</hi> vnto him? or can God <hi>complaine</hi> that they are such? What can be said vnto it?</p>
                  <p>Will you, that I speake properly, without a figure? Then thus I say: <hi>God cannot</hi> complaine, <hi>because he cannot be</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, <hi>or</hi> grieued. Could he be burdened or grieued, hee could <hi>suffer:</hi> But he cannot <hi>suffer.</hi> Euery blow of ours, though we were as strong and high, <hi>as the sonnes of Anak,</hi> light short of him. If some could haue reached him, it had gone ill with him long ere this. But <hi>God cannot suffer.</hi> So
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:1741:167"/> true is that axiome of the Schooles: <hi>No passion can befall the Deitie. Aquinas</hi> 1. <hi>qu.</hi> 20. <hi>art.</hi> 1. thus deliuers it: <hi>Nulla pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio est in Deo;</hi> there is no passion in God: and <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Contra Gentiles cap.</hi> 89. <hi>In Deo non sunt Passiones affectuum;</hi> there are no <hi>aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Well then, if these <hi>passions</hi> of <hi>complaining,</hi> of <hi>repenting</hi> of <hi>grieuing,</hi> of <hi>fainting,</hi> and the like, cannot <hi>properly</hi> be sayd to be in God, how are they so frequently in holy Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto him?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>God in holy Scripture speaking of himselfe as if these passions were familiar with him, he appeares as transfigured into the likenesse of our nature, and in our owne familiar termes speaketh to our shallow vnderstandings. As an old man speaking to a child, frames his voyce in a childish phrase. So God speaking to vs men, speakes as the manner of men is to speake. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue you my answere to the question euen now propounded. The question was: <hi>How God may be sayd to complaine of our sinnes, to be burdened with them, or to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at them, sith in himselfe he hath all pleasure and content?</hi> My answere is, <hi>He cannot be said so to doe in a proper sense and vnderstanding,</hi> because God is not obnoxious to any passion, but <hi>improperly, in a figure, abusiuely, metaphorically, by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropopathie, and metonymically, he may well be sayd so to doe:</hi> he may well be sayd to <hi>complaine</hi> of our sinnes, to be <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened</hi> with them, and to be <hi>grieued</hi> at them. So he <hi>complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> against <hi>Israel,</hi> here in my text; <hi>I am pressed vnder you, as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto haue I stood vpon the first Interpretation of these words, depending vpon the <hi>intransitiue</hi> or <hi>newtrall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification</hi> of the Hebrew <hi>verbe</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> I <hi>am pressed.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interpretation growing vpon the <hi>transitiue</hi> significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same verbe, is put in the Margent of our newest <hi>English</hi> translation, and thus it is,
<q>I will presse your place, as a Cart full of sheaues presseth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the very reading of <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Iunius. Ionathan</hi> doth not much varie from it; nor <hi>R. Abraham,</hi> and other
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1741:168"/> Hebrew Doctors, nor the wise men of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as <hi>Pagnine</hi> hath obserued. Our new expositors for the most part doe mention it, <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Danaeus, Brentius</hi> and <hi>Winclelman, Mercerus</hi> and <hi>Quadratus, Christopherus à Castro,</hi> and <hi>Petrus à Figuiero,</hi> I will presse you.</p>
                  <p>In an old English Bible, It may be <hi>Taverners</hi> translation) I find this place thus Interpreted; <hi>I will crashe you in sunder, like as a wayne crasheth, that is full of sheaues.</hi> I will <hi>crash you,</hi> or, I will <hi>presse you:</hi> the meaning is the same: and thus I pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase it,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I]</hi> the <hi>Lord, Iehovah,</hi> your Lord God, <hi>will presse your place,</hi> wheresoeuer it shall be; But how? Either <hi>as a cart full loaden with sheaues presseth]</hi> the earth, and whatsoeuer else it passeth ouer; or <hi>as a cart full loaden presseth the sheaues in the threshing floare:</hi> or <hi>as a cart full loaden with sheaues is it selfe pressed.</hi> I will presse you, <hi>as a cart full of sheaues presseth,</hi> or <hi>is pressed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this second Interpretation of my text, my text is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatorie.</hi> The Lord threatneth to punish <hi>Israel</hi> for their sinnes; to punish them <hi>non levi manu, aut viribus languidis,</hi> not with a light hand, or languishing force, <hi>sed magno nisu ac robore,</hi> but with great endeuour and strength. <hi>I will presse you, as a cart full of sheaues presseth,</hi> or is <hi>pressed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God euer iust, and immutable, assigneth to like sinnes like punishments. We for sinning come not short of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> May we not then well expect their <hi>punishments?</hi> Yes doubtlesse, we may: and this <hi>Commination</hi> may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to vs, as to them; <hi>I will presse you, as a cart full of sheaues presseth,</hi> or is <hi>pressed.</hi> From this <hi>Commination</hi> we may take this lesson:
<q>God will neuer suffer sinne to escape altogether vnpunished.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He will not. His <hi>commination</hi> of punishment giuen in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi> to the transgressor of his law, is a proofe of this truth. The <hi>Commination</hi> is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof,</hi> [of the tree of knowledge of good and euill] <hi>thou shalt dye the death. Adam</hi> transgressed the Law; it was his

                  <p>Hitherto belongeth that <hi>malediction,</hi> Deut. 27.26. which is repeated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Cursed is euery one, that continueth not in all things, which are written in the Booke of the Law, to doe them.</hi> Now <hi>God</hi> is euer true in his sayings, and he euer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth, what he saith.

                  <p>So true is my Doctrine,
<q>God will neuer suffer sinne to escape altogether vnpunished.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the further illustration of this truth, I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the suffrages of the auncient; of <hi>Austine,</hi> and of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie.</hi> But hauing elsewhere done that in my 18. Sermon vpon the 10. of <hi>Hoseah,</hi> I will not now againe doe it: and what need I draw from the <hi>Riuers,</hi> when I am full of the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:1741:169"/>
                     <hi>fountaine?</hi> Yet may I not end, without making some vse hereof.</p>
                  <p>My first vse shall be, to reprooue such as teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as <hi>Socinus Osterodius, Gittichius,</hi> and other the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Christs satisfaction.</hi> They will thus argue: if God will neuer suffer sinne <hi>to escape vnpunished,</hi> then belike hee <hi>casteth all men into Hell,</hi> there to be <hi>punished</hi> with infernall torments.</p>
                  <p>I answere, No. <hi>Sed quosdam infernalibus poenis punit, caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris peccata remittit:</hi> Farre bee it from God, that he should punish all, the <hi>Elect</hi> as well as the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> with infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments. Some, <hi>all the Reprobate,</hi> he so punisheth: but to others, to <hi>all the Elect,</hi> he forgiues their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Their reply here is: Doth God forgiue <hi>the Elect</hi> their sinnes? Why then it is likely, he leaues them <hi>altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our answere is: Not so. God doth not leaue the sinnes of the <hi>Elect altogether vnpunished;</hi> but doth <hi>punish</hi> them all, by <hi>translating</hi> their sinnes from them, to his owne sonne, <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> according to that, <hi>Esay</hi> 53.6. The <hi>Lord hath laid on him the iniquitie of vs all. He was wounded for our transgressions;</hi> he <hi>was bruised for our iniquities.</hi> The summe of all is; Our transgressions, our iniquities, our sinnes God <hi>punisheth</hi> in Christ, and for his sake <hi>forgiues</hi> them vs. Thus farre the reproofe.</p>
                  <p>My second Vse is, a short word of exhortation. Will not God suffer any sinne to escape <hi>altogether vnpunished?</hi> What then shall become of vs, beloued? Our sinnes! Are they not impudent and vnblushing? Are they not acted with lifting vp the <hi>hand,</hi> and <hi>heele</hi> against God? The <hi>hand</hi> in opposition, the <hi>heele</hi> in contempt? Our <hi>sinnes!</hi> They keepe not low water; the tyde of them is euer swelling: they are obiects to the <hi>eye</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and are proud, that they are obserued.</p>
                  <p>I haue read of two <hi>ladders,</hi> by which men climbe to Heauen; <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>sinnes:</hi> the godly by their <hi>prayers;</hi> the

                  </p>
                  <p>Must be! Yea, sayth S. <hi>Austine Enarrat. in Psal.</hi> 58. <hi>Iniquitas omnis, parva magnáue fit, puniatur necesse est:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sinne, be it great, or be it little, must of necessitie bee punished.</p>
                  <p>Must it! By whom? He there tells you, <hi>aut ab ipso ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine poenitente, aut a Deo vindicante;</hi> eyther by man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, or by God reuenging. For <hi>quem poenitet, scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum punit,</hi> who so <hi>repenteth</hi> of his sinnes, he <hi>punisheth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for his sinnes. <hi>Ergo, fratres, puniamus peccata nostra:</hi> therefore brethren, let vs be our owne punishers: <hi>punish</hi> we our selues, our <hi>sinnes,</hi> that God may haue mercie on vs.</p>
                  <p>He cannot shew mercie vpon workers of iniquitie, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si blandiens peccatis, aut non eradicens peccata,</hi> as if he flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red men in their sinnes, or had no purpose to roote out sinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prorsus aut punis, aut punit.</hi> Beleeue it either thou must punish thy selfe, or God will punish thee. <hi>Vis non puniat, punitu.</hi> Wilt thou that God should not punish thee, then punish thou thy selfe: and wash away thy sinnes with the salt and bitter teares of vnfeined Repentance, through a liuely faith in the bloud of our Lord and Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> So shall not thy sinnes be layed vnto thy Charge: but they shall be as a bundle that is bound vp and is cast into the bottome of the Sea: they shall neuer rise vp against thee.</p>
                  <p>If thou thus punish thy selfe, God will not complaine of thee, that he is <hi>pressed</hi> vnder thee <hi>as a Cart is pressed, that is full of sheaues:</hi> nor will he threaten, to <hi>presse</hi> thee, <hi>as a Cart full of sheaues presseth,</hi> or is <hi>pressed.</hi>

               <p>THE defiance is set, the trumpet is blowne, the warre is proclaimed from <hi>the Maiestie of heauen,</hi> against the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of the <hi>ten tribes of Israel.</hi> Such was the height of their impieties, discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8. such the foulenesse of their ingratitude, blased <hi>vers.</hi> 12. that they could not looke for lesse, then a dissipation, a dispersion and ouerthrow by warre.</p>
               <p>The proclamation you heard of, of late, out of the 13. <hi>verse,</hi> it was made, either by way of a grieuous complaint, <hi>Behold, I am pressed vnder you, as a cart is pressed, that is full of sheaues:</hi> or by way of a terrible commination, <hi>Behold, I will presse you, as a cart full of sheaues presseth,</hi> or <hi>is pressed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The successe and euent of this warre now followeth, <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15, 16. wherein three generals haue bin obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: <hi>Impotentia fugiendi, Debilitas in resistendo,</hi> and <hi>Fuga fortium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first was, their <hi>impotencie</hi> and <hi>vnablenesse</hi> to escape
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:1741:171"/> by <hi>flight</hi> in the day of battell: the second, their <hi>debilitie</hi> and weaknesse in resisting the enemie: the third, the <hi>flight</hi> of their most valiant and stout of heart. Three generalls they are, and are by our Prophet diuided into seauen se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall branches: in which he describes <hi>gravitatem tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis,</hi> as <hi>Castrus</hi> speaketh, the grieuousnes of their tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; or as <hi>Quadratus, summam calamitatem &amp; augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> the extreame miserie and anguish, whereinto they were to fall.</p>
               <p>He sheweth Gods iudgements to be ineluctable. If he will the punishment of any, there is no place <hi>for refuge,</hi> no <hi>evasion,</hi> no meanes to <hi>escape.</hi> Neither he that is of an <hi>expedite</hi> and agile <hi>bodie,</hi> nor the <hi>strong</hi> man, nor the <hi>mighty,</hi> nor the <hi>bow-man,</hi> nor the <hi>swift of foote,</hi> nor the <hi>horseman,</hi> nor the <hi>couragious and stout of heart,</hi> shall be able to helpe himselfe <hi>in that day,</hi> in the day of Gods reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thus haue you summarily the scope of our <hi>Prophet</hi> in this Scripture, and the meaning thereof. I must now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the particulars. The first of the seauen miseries, here foretold to betide the <hi>Israelites,</hi> is in the beginning of the 14. <hi>verse.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The flight shall perish from the swift.</head>
                  <p>IT is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> phrase. I meete with the like, <hi>Psal.</hi> 142.4. <hi>Perijt fuga à me.</hi> So <hi>Dauid</hi> in extreame danger in the Caue, complaineth: The <hi>flight</hi> perished from me, or <hi>Refuge</hi> failed me; or, I had no place <hi>to flie</hi> vnto: that is, I saw not which way I might escape; all hope of evasion was gone from me; I was in mine owne eyes, of necessity to haue perished. <hi>Perijt fuga à me,</hi> The flight perished from mee.</p>
                  <p>The like forme of speech is, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 25.35. <hi>Peribit fuga à pastoribus, &amp; saluatio ab optimaribus gregis:</hi> The <hi>flight</hi> shall <hi>perish</hi> from the shepheards, and <hi>safetie</hi> from the chiefe of the flocke: that is, The shepheards shall haue no way to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1741:171"/> flee, and <hi>the principall of the flocke,</hi> the Rams of the flocke shall haue no way to escape; <hi>Peribit fuga,</hi> the <hi>flight</hi> shall <hi>perish</hi> from the shepheards, and <hi>saftie</hi> from the chiefe of the flocke.</p>
                  <p>So, <hi>Iob</hi> 11.20. it is part of the infelicitie of the wicked, <hi>Peribit fuga ab cis,</hi> flight shall perish from them, that is, they shall not escape.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of this phrase is well expressed, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.1. <hi>Non erit fuga cis qui fugient, &amp; non saluabitur ex cis, qui fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit.</hi> He that fleeth of them, shall not <hi>flee away,</hi> and he that escapeth of them, shall not <hi>be deliuered.</hi> Surely from such <hi>peribit fuga,</hi> flight shall perish; <hi>flee</hi> they may, but by their flight they shall not <hi>escape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peribit fuga,</hi> the <hi>flight shall perish from the swift.</hi> As the <hi>flight</hi> perisheth, so may other things be said to perish, the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Counsell,</hi> and the <hi>Word;</hi> the Law from the <hi>Priest,</hi> and counsell from the <hi>wise,</hi> and the word from the <hi>Prophet. Ier.</hi> 18.18.</p>
                  <p>So, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 7.26. it is said, <hi>The law shall perish from the Priest, and counsell from the Ancients.</hi> And <hi>Ierem.</hi> 49.7. <hi>Counsell is perished from the prudent.</hi> And <hi>Esai.</hi> 29.14. <hi>the wisdome of the wise men shall perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>law,</hi> and the <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>wisdome,</hi> and <hi>counsell</hi> to <hi>perish</hi> from the <hi>Priest,</hi> from the <hi>Prophet,</hi> from the <hi>Wise,</hi> from the <hi>Prudent,</hi> and from the <hi>Ancient,</hi> what else is it, then for such men to be destitute of such things; the <hi>Priest</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>wise,</hi> the <hi>prudent,</hi> and the <hi>ancient,</hi> of <hi>wisedome</hi> and <hi>counsell?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So touching my text, I say, for <hi>the flight to perish from the swift,</hi> it is nothing else, then for the <hi>swift</hi> to be destitute of <hi>flight,</hi> to be depriued of <hi>flight,</hi> to be altogither vnable to <hi>flee away,</hi> when he would.</p>
                  <q>The flight shall perish from the swift.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>swift!</hi> Who is that? The old <hi>Hebrewes</hi> say, it is <hi>Ieroboam, sonne of Nebat</hi>

                  <p>From the first of these seauen miseries thus expressed in this first branch, <hi>The flight shall perish from the swift,</hi> we may take this lesson,
<q>When God resolueth to punish man for sinne, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for him, no evasion, no escaping by flight, though he be of a swift, an expedite, and an agile bodie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth <hi>Albertus</hi> would ratifie with those words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9 2. <hi>Velox pedibus offendet.</hi> He that is swift of foote <hi>offendeth,</hi> stumbleth, hitteth against some stone, or stump, and so falleth, and is ouertaken. But the allegation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. The words are against <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>vnaduised acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in the course of mans life; and doe beare with them
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1741:172"/> this sense: As he that runneth hastily, if he looke not to his feete, that he may chuse the good way, and leaue the bad, is in great danger of continuall falling: so he, that hastily and without due deliberation goeth about this or that, may easily transgresse before he be aware. This sense is naturall to the words, as we render them: <hi>He that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth with his feete, sinneth.</hi> If thou runne hastily to euill, thou sinnest against God and thine owne soule.</p>
                  <p>The other place alleaged by <hi>Albertus</hi> to proue, that there is no evasion, no escaping for the <hi>swift,</hi> is more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. It is in <hi>Esay chap.</hi> 30.16. <hi>Velociores erunt, qui perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentur vos.</hi> Thinke you not by <hi>flight</hi> to saue your selues: for they, that shall pursue you, shall be as <hi>swift</hi> as you, or <hi>swifter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As pertinent is that of the Preacher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.11. <hi>There is no race to the swift,</hi> or, <hi>in running it helpeth not to be swift.</hi> The meaning of it the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> thus expresseth: though men be as <hi>swift</hi> as <hi>Eagles,</hi> yet shall they not <hi>by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> helpe themselues, or deliuer themselues from death in the day of battell. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> refer this to <hi>Hasahel,</hi> one of the sonnes of <hi>Tzeruiah,</hi> who though he were an exceeding <hi>swift</hi> runner, <hi>as light of foote as a wilde Roe,</hi> as he is described, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.18. yet could he not escape, but he must be slaine<note n="k" place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.23.</note> by <hi>Abner.</hi>

                  <p>But these I take to be either <hi>fabulous,</hi> or <hi>hyperbolicall.</hi> Yet say, there were such; say, there are such; I say, neither was there for them, neither is there for these, any <hi>evasion,</hi> or <hi>escaping</hi> from God.

                  <p>Not deliuer himselfe! and yet <hi>swift of foote.</hi> It is euen so. Why may he not <hi>attempt</hi> to flee?

                  <p>Is there no <hi>refuge</hi> for vs, no <hi>evasion,</hi> no <hi>escaping by flight,</hi> when God will punish? No, there is none.

                  <p>Will there be no <hi>refuge</hi> for vs, no <hi>evasion,</hi> no <hi>escaping by flight,</hi> when God will visit for our sinnes? What shall we then doe beloued?

                  <p>To like purpose the same <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p>Vnderstand not any locall flying <hi>de loco ad locum,</hi> but a flying <hi>de vitâ advitam, de actu ad actum, de bonis ad meliora, de vtilibus ad vtiliora, de sanctis ad sanctiora,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Homil.</hi> 12. <hi>in Genesin,</hi> and so mayst thou <hi>flee to God.</hi> Flee from <hi>life</hi> to <hi>life,</hi> from an euill life to a good life; from <hi>act</hi> to <hi>act,</hi> from an euill act to a good act; from <hi>good</hi> to <hi>better;</hi> from <hi>profitable</hi> courses to <hi>more profitable;</hi> from

                     <hi>sanctified</hi> thoughts to <hi>more sanctified;</hi> and thou doest flee to God.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus to <hi>flee to God,</hi> is nothing else, then to <hi>draw neere vnto him,</hi> to <hi>haue accesse vnto him,</hi> to <hi>come vnto him.</hi>

Bow</hi> and arrowes! There is no helpe in them. None at all: nor in the <hi>sword;</hi> nor in any other <hi>militarie engine.</hi> Therefore doth the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 44 6. renounce all trust in them. His words are, <hi>I doe not trust in my bow, neither can my sword saue me.</hi> His <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>sword,</hi> he doth not much care for. Wherein then is his trust? It is in the might and strength of God. <hi>Gods power</hi> was his <hi>buckler,</hi> whereto he trusted for his owne defence, and for the discomfiture of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>It is the Vse we are to make of the doctrine now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. We must not repose our trust in any externall helpe, the <hi>bow,</hi> the <hi>sword,</hi> or the like, for this were indeed, to rob <hi>God</hi> of his glory, and to runne to the <hi>creature</hi> for helpe. Our helpe is but one; and that is the <hi>Lord of Hosts. Dominus Deus auxiliator meus: Esay</hi> proclaimeth it twise in one chapter, <hi>chap.</hi> 50.

                  <p>Now to the question: My answer is; <hi>Non reijcitur vsus, sed fiducia.</hi> The <hi>bow,</hi> the <hi>sword,</hi> the <hi>speare,</hi> and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of warre, are not <hi>to be condemned,</hi> not <hi>to be cast away,</hi> not <hi>to be neglected,</hi> but to be vsed. <hi>Non reijcitur vsus, sed fiducia;</hi> their <hi>vse</hi> is not forbidden, but <hi>our trust</hi> in them. The <hi>vse</hi> of all kinde of weapons is common as well to the wicked as to the godly: the difference is in the <hi>trust.</hi> The wicked, they <hi>vse</hi> them, and <hi>trust</hi> in them; the godly, they <hi>vse</hi> them too, but their <hi>trust</hi> mounts higher, euen to the Lord of Hosts. The distinction then here to be obserued is, <hi>Ʋt vsus creaturis fiducia verò creatori depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetur.</hi> Vse the <hi>bow,</hi> the <hi>sword,</hi> the <hi>speare,</hi> and euery other martiall weapon when thou shalt haue iust occasion; but see that thy <hi>trust</hi> be euer in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> vpon those words of the 44. Psalme, <hi>I trust not in my bow, neither shall my sword saue me,</hi> saith: Why then dost thou <hi>vse</hi> them? Why art thou <hi>armed?</hi> VVhy handlest thou the <hi>bow?</hi> VVhy the <hi>sword?</hi> The answer there is returned; Because our God hath so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>therefore I vse them:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>fight</hi> against him is a <hi>daily fight.</hi> For our direction in this <hi>fight,</hi> we haue <hi>S.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1741:179"/> before thee, not for our owne righteousnesse, but for thy great mercies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saue vs, O Lord, saue thy people, from the power and furie of this immortall enemie. Though as a roaring Lyon he walketh about seeking whom he may devoure, yet shall we, placing all our hope and confidence in thee our Lord and God, be safe vnder thy protection. Protect &amp; keep vs, O Lord, among the manifold dangers of this life, and in thy good time, by the conduct of thy fauour, bring vs home from this valley of miserie and mourning, to that our hoped-for country of eternall glory, where we may with all Saints sing vnto thee a perpetuall Halleluiah.

               <p>I Now bring you the remainder of the fourth part of <hi>Amos</hi> his first Sermon. I called it heretofore a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi> I still call it so. It conteineth menacings, or threats against the kingdome of the <hi>ten tribes,</hi> the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> for the foulnesse of their ingratitude. These menacings or threats proceeding from him who onely is omnipotent, and al-sufficient to effect what he threatneth, euen from the Lord, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> doe plainely demonstrate, that Gods iudgements are ineluctable, not to be auoyded. If <hi>God</hi> will the punishment of any, there is no place for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> no <hi>euasion,</hi> no meanes to escape. Neither he that is of an <hi>expedite</hi> and <hi>agile bodie,</hi> nor the <hi>strong man,</hi> nor the <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> nor the <hi>bow-man,</hi> nor the <hi>swift of foote,</hi> nor the <hi>horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> nor the <hi>couragious,</hi> and stout <hi>of heart</hi> shall be able to helpe himselfe <hi>in that day,</hi> in the day of Gods vengeance.</p>
               <p>Seauen particulars are here disabled from helping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>in that day,</hi> when the <hi>Lord</hi> will be pleased to execute vengeance for sinne. Of foure of them, you heard at large in my last Lecture out of this place, that, neither he that is of an <hi>expedite</hi> and <hi>agile bodie,</hi> nor the <hi>strong man,</hi> nor the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:1741:180"/>
                  <hi>mightie,</hi> nor the <hi>bow-man,</hi> can any way helpe themselues. Let it please you now to giue eare; and you shall heare as much of the other three; of the <hi>swift of foote,</hi> of the <hi>horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> of the <hi>couragious</hi> and stout <hi>of heart.</hi> Begin we with the <hi>swift of foote.</hi> It is the next branch that followeth, <hi>vers.</hi> 15.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe originall is; <hi>the swift of foote shall not deliuer.</hi> Shall <hi>not deliuer!</hi> What shall he not deliuer; Supply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect according to the last clauses of this and the former verse: and the full shall be, <hi>Velox pedibus, non liberabit ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam suam,</hi> the swift of foote shall not deliuer <hi>his soule;</hi> His soule, that is, <hi>his life,</hi> or <hi>himselfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Author of the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> here readeth, <hi>Velox pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus suis non salvabitur</hi> the swift of foot shall not be saued. So doth S. <hi>Hierome;</hi> so the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> so an old<note n="a" place="margin">In Bibliothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>câ Nicolsonianà in aede Christi Oxen.</note> English <hi>Manuscript.</hi> Some read thus: <hi>The swift of foote shall not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,</hi> as the <hi>Caldee Paraphrast,</hi> and <hi>Montanus,</hi> and <hi>Munster,</hi> and our late <hi>Church Bible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Admit of which reading you will, you cannot misse of the true vnderstanding of the place. Read if you will; the swift of foote <hi>shall not be saued,</hi> or, <hi>shall not escape,</hi> or, <hi>shall not deliuer himselfe;</hi> you will forth-with vnderstand, that, a man cannot <hi>by the swiftnesse of his feete</hi> out-runne God. This is the very marrow of that lesson, which we are to learne from hence. The lesson is:
<q>The swift of foote hath no aduantage aboue others, for the sauing of himselfe, if God doe once resolue to punish.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This agreeth with that which I haue obserued vpon the first clause of the 14. <hi>verse: The flight shall perish from the swift.</hi> With that, this which we haue now in hand is coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>The flight shall perish from the swift,</hi> and, <hi>The swift of foote shall not deliuer himselfe;</hi> these two, to the vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are but one, and doe yeeld vnto vs one and the same obseruation. The obseruation is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When God resolues to punish man for sinne, there is no refuge
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1741:181"/> for him, no euasion, no escaping by flight, though he be of a swift, an expedite, and an agile boate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This truth stands ratified with that in the ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Prophecie, vers. 1. <hi>Non erit fuga eis, quisugient, &amp; non salvabitur ex eis, qui fugerit.</hi> He that <hi>fleeth</hi> of them, shall not <hi>flee away;</hi> and he that <hi>escapeth</hi> of them shall not be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.</hi> And with that <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.11. <hi>There is no race to the swift,</hi> or, <hi>In running it helpeth not to be swift:</hi> that is, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> expounds the place; Though men be as swift <hi>as Eagles,</hi> yet shall they not <hi>by running</hi> helpe themselues, or deliuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from death <hi>in the day of battell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The many euidences of holy Writ, which are vsually brought to proue, that <hi>God is euery where present,</hi> and <hi>in all places at once,</hi> may serue for a further ratification of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded doctrine. For if God <hi>be euery where present,</hi> if he be <hi>at once in all places,</hi> then certainely there is <hi>no refuge</hi> for man against him, no <hi>euasion,</hi> no <hi>escaping</hi> by flight. Nor the <hi>caues</hi> of the earth, nor the <hi>secrets</hi> of walls, nor the <hi>darkenesse</hi> of the night, nor the <hi>distance</hi> of place by land or by sea, can <hi>hide vs from his presence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can they not? How then may that be excused which we read of <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. that they <hi>HID</hi> themselues <hi>from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden?</hi> How that which we read of <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.16. that he went <hi>cut from the presence of the Lord?</hi> How that which we read of <hi>Ionah, chap.</hi> 1.3. that he, when he was sent to <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iveh,</hi> rose vp <hi>to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These scruples I am now to remoue: The first concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife, their <hi>hiding</hi> themselues among the trees of <hi>Paradise.</hi> Some say; <hi>Adam</hi> hid himselfe through feare, not as if he could <hi>flee from God,</hi> but because hee thought himselfe vnworthie <hi>to come into Gods</hi> sight. So <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus lib</hi> 3 <hi>adversus haereses cap.</hi> 37. He seemes to take in good part this flight of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his endeuour to <hi>hide</hi> himselfe, as if it proceeded from a pious and profitable feare and dread of an humble and repentant soule.</p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:1741:181"/>
                  <p>Other say, that <hi>Adam</hi> exceedingly troubled in mind, much ashamed and afraid, that he had transgressed the commandement of God, like vnto a mad man, that knows not which way to turne himselfe, went about to <hi>hide</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. So S. <hi>Austine lib.</hi> 11. <hi>de Genesi ad literam cap.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>A third opinion there is, that taxeth <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> of infidelitie and impenitencie, for <hi>hiding</hi> of themselues: as if guiltie of transgression, they had thought simply to <hi>hide</hi> themselues from the presence of God. Of this opinion I find <hi>Rupertus,</hi> who <hi>Comment. in Genesin lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. thus expresseth himselfe. <hi>Abscondendo se, vter{que} de Deo malè sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, &amp; sibi insipienter providit, tanquam impaenitens, tanquam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelis. Adam</hi> and his wife in hiding themselues thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse concerning God, and prouided foolishly for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as if they had beene impenitent and vnbeleeuing.</p>
                  <p>It is no ill or idle opinion, to say that, Perhaps <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>wife,</hi> for want of experience (for they had neuer fallen before) might thinke, that by running among the trees of Paradise they might <hi>hide</hi> themselues. But when God had once found them out (and quickly he found them out) they could not any longer so thinke. Then they could not but be resolued vpon this; that there is no <hi>fleeing away,</hi> no <hi>hiding</hi> of our selues from <hi>the presence of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is the first scruple remoued. <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>wife</hi> hid themselues <hi>from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of a garden.</hi> They <hi>hid</hi> themselues, that is, they <hi>would haue hid</hi> themselues, they <hi>would</hi> but <hi>could</hi> not.</p>
                  <p>The second scruple, concerneth <hi>Caine</hi> his going out <hi>from the presence of the Lord.</hi> If <hi>Cain</hi> could <hi>goe out</hi> from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord, how is the <hi>Lord euery where present?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For answere hereunto we are to note, that the <hi>presence</hi> of God doth sometime in holy Scripture betoken the place of his presence; the place where God was first worshipped by sacrifice, and shewed visible signes of his <hi>presence:</hi> And that it doth sometime signifie the <hi>grace</hi> of God, his <hi>fauour,</hi> his <hi>care,</hi> his <hi>prouidence,</hi> and <hi>protection.</hi> In both these respects may <hi>Cain</hi> be said to haue gone out <hi>from the presence of the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:1741:182"/> Lord.</hi> For first he was expelled from the land of his natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, from that land where God was wont to shew his face, and vnder the visible forme of humane nature, to talke with man familiarly: and secondly he was excluded from Gods <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>fauour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much doth <hi>Cain</hi> himselfe confesse, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>Behold, thou hast driuen me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid,</hi> and I <hi>shall be a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue and a vagabond in the earth.</hi> Thou hast <hi>driuen me out this day from the face of the earth,</hi> that is, Thou expellest me from my natiue soyle, which to me is most deare &amp; sweete, wherein I was borne, haue beene bred vp, and haue liued with my parents and kins-folke euen vnto this day: thou <hi>driuest me out</hi> from a most fruitfull and pleasant <hi>land,</hi> a <hi>land,</hi> that is next to the Paradise of the earth; a <hi>land,</hi> which thou hast consecrated to thy selfe, to be the land of thy sacrifices oblations, and holy worship; a <hi>land</hi> wherein thou art wont to manifest thy selfe vnto men, and to instruct them by thy sacred oracles, and answers. From this <hi>land,</hi> the land of my natiuitie, thou <hi>driuest me out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And from thy face shall I be hid]</hi> I shall for euer and euery where, find thee displeased with me, angry at me, and mine enemy, to the intollerable horrour and amazement of my minde: thou wilt not deigne to looke vpon me with the eyes of thy mercie, but wilt for euer hide thy face from me, and so depriue me of thy singular beneuolence, care, tutele and protection. So was <hi>Cain</hi> hid from the <hi>face of the Lord,</hi> and so <hi>went he out from his presence.</hi> Otherwise hee could not be <hi>hid,</hi> he would not <hi>goe out</hi> from the presence of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The third scruple concerneth <hi>Ionah</hi> his fleeing to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shish,</hi> from the <hi>presence</hi> of the Lord. If <hi>Ionah</hi> could flee to <hi>Tarshish</hi> from the presence of the Lord, how is the Lord <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where present?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this fleeing of <hi>Ionah</hi> from the presence of the Lord, there is a twofold vnderstanding. Some thus vnderstand it; that he left the whole border and ground of <hi>Israel,</hi> where
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1741:182"/> the <hi>presence of the Lord,</hi> though it were not more then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, was yet more euident by the <hi>manifestations</hi> of his fauours and graces towards them. There was the <hi>arke</hi> of the <hi>couenant,</hi> and the <hi>sanctuary,</hi> there the <hi>Lord</hi> gaue them answere by <hi>dreames,</hi> and <hi>oracles:</hi> there were other more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauours of the Lords abode there.</p>
                  <p>Others by this fleeing of <hi>Ionah</hi> from the presence of the <hi>Lord,</hi> doe vnderstand his turning his backe vpon the <hi>Lord,</hi> his shaking off the yoke of the <hi>Lord,</hi> his wilfull renouncing the Commandement of the <hi>Lord;</hi> his departing from his dutie and from the execution of his office, enioyned him by the Lord.</p>
                  <p>In the language of the Scripture, they are said <hi>to be in the Lords presence,</hi> or to <hi>stand before the Lord,</hi> who doe carefully attend his pleasure, and are readie to receiue and execute whatsoeuer he imposeth. In the 10. of <hi>Deut. vers.</hi> 8. The Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> is separated by the Lord, <hi>to stand before the Lord. To stand before the Lord,</hi> that is, as it is there expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>to minister vnto the Lord, and to blesse in his name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So is the phrase vsed by <hi>Elias,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 17.1. Where thus saith he, vnto <hi>Ahab: As the Lord God of</hi> Israell <hi>liueth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor raine these yeares, but according to my word.</hi> The Lord God, <hi>before whom I stand;</hi> that is, the Lord God, whom faithfully I doe serue. And so is it by <hi>Elizeus</hi> in those his words to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian.</hi> 2. King. 5.16. <hi>As the Lord liueth</hi> before whom I stand, <hi>I will receiue no blessing of thee.</hi> As the Lord liueth <hi>before whom I stand,</hi> a witnesse to my actions, the searcher of my heart, whose honour and seruice I tender more then mine owne gaine, I will receiue no blessing, no reward of thee.</p>
                  <p>Now if they, who duely serue the Lord, are said <hi>to stand before the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to be in his presence,</hi> then may they who cast off the yoke of the seruice due vnto him, well be said to <hi>hide themselues from the face of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to flee from his presence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see now what this phrase of <hi>fleeing from the presence of the Lord</hi> doth meane. It giues vs to vnderstand, that <hi>Ionas,</hi>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:1741:183"/> as a fugitiue and refractary seruant ranne <hi>from the Lord,</hi> breaking his bonds of dutie, and making no conscience or care to <hi>doe him seruice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus are the scruples done away and my doctrine stands good,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no refuge, no euasion, no escaping, no hiding, no fleeing from the face of the Lord, from his presence, from his iudgments,</hi> no <hi>not for the swift of foote.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well. What if the <hi>footman</hi> for all his <hi>swiftnesse</hi> cannot saue himselfe; fares it not better with the <hi>horseman?</hi> Cannot he <hi>deliuer himselfe?</hi> No. He cannot. He is disabled in the next words,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither shall he that rideth the horse deliuer himselfe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Thus haue you the Grammaticall sense and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these words, <hi>He that rideth the horse shall not deliuer himselfe:</hi> This rider of the horse, this horseman mounting, sitting, or carried on horsebacke, shall not deliuer, shall not saue his <hi>soule,</hi> his <hi>life, himselfe.</hi> The lesson we are to learne from hence, is,

                  <p>Be thine horse euery way answerable to that Horse (of which thou maist read in the Booke of <hi>Iob chap.</hi> 39.) whose <hi>necke</hi> is <hi>clothed with thunder,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of whose <hi>nostrils is terrour;</hi> that <hi>paweth in the valley, and reioyceth in his strength,</hi> and <hi>goeth on to meet the armed men;</hi> that <hi>mocketh at feare and is not affrighted,</hi> and <hi>turnes not backe from the sword:</hi> no, though <hi>the quiuer rattle against him,</hi> though the <hi>speare</hi> and <hi>shield doe glister,</hi> yet <hi>swalloweth he the ground with fiercenesse and rage. The sound of the trumpet</hi> terrifieth him not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyceth him: for he <hi>smelleth the battell a farre off, the thunder of the Captaines, and the shouting.</hi> Be thine <hi>horse</hi> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way answerable to this <hi>horse,</hi> yet repose not any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him for thy saftie: for he will fayle thee.</p>
                  <p>He will doe so. What else is it that thou readest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.17. <hi>An horse is a vaine thing to saue a man, neither shall he deliuer any by his great strength.</hi> Let S. <hi>Austine</hi> instruct thee, <hi>Mentitur tibi equus, quandò promittit salutem:</hi> if thy <hi>horse</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise thee safetie, he lyeth vnto thee. The promise of a <hi>horse! Nunquid equus alicui loquitur, &amp; promittit salutem?</hi> Doth
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:1741:184"/> a horse <hi>speake</hi> to man? doth he <hi>promise</hi> him safetie? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. Yet when thou considerest the comely feature and proportion of thy horse, his stout courage, his admired swiftnesse, <hi>ista omnia, velut promittunt tibi de illo salutem,</hi> all these things doe, as it were promise thee saftie by him. <hi>Sed fallunt, si Deus non tuetur,</hi> but without the especiall blessing of God all these things will fayle thee. For, <hi>Mendax equus ad salutem,</hi> an horse is a lying thing for safetie, a vaine thing to <hi>saue</hi> a man, and shall not <hi>deliuer any man by his great strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is it, which you may read in the Booke of <hi>Prouerbs chap.</hi> 21.31. <hi>The horse is prepared against the day of battell, but safetie is of the Lord.</hi> Let the <hi>horse</hi> be made readie, let him be throughly furnished for the warre, yet relie not vpon him for thy safetie. For <hi>safetie,</hi> all <hi>safetie</hi> is of the Lord, and of him alone. Let the Lord rebuke, yea, let him but speake the word, both the <hi>chariot</hi> and <hi>horse</hi> shall be <hi>cast into a dead sleepe.</hi> So we read, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76.6. The meaning is: By the onely word of the <hi>Lord</hi> it often comes to passe, that they who trust in their <hi>Chariots</hi> and <hi>Horses,</hi> doe vanish &amp; come to naught, like a <hi>dreame,</hi> yea, like the <hi>shadow of a dreame.</hi>

                     <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> proud and cruell <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> sory that he had let the <hi>children of Israel</hi> goe, would needs goe fetch them backe againe. He assured himselfe before hand of successe, either to spoyle them, or to reduce them to bondage. In the strength of his conceit, furnishing himselfe with <hi>horses</hi> and <hi>chariots</hi> of warre, <hi>six hundred chariots,</hi> and <hi>all the chariots of Egypt,</hi> accompanied with his <hi>nobles, captaines,</hi> and <hi>souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> he marched furiously and pursued the <hi>Israelites,</hi> euen to the <hi>middest</hi> of the <hi>Red Sea:</hi> To the <hi>middest</hi> of that <hi>Sea</hi> they came, &amp; no one waue rose vp against them, to wet so much as the hoofes of their <hi>horses.</hi> When they were come <hi>so far</hi> (too farre to returne) they were sodainely striken with their last terrour. Their <hi>chariots</hi> and <hi>horses,</hi> in which they trusted, fayled them, as hauing done them seruice enough, to carry them into perdition. For the <hi>Sea</hi> shut her mouth vpon them, and <hi>swallowed them vp in her waues:</hi> you know
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:1741:184"/> it to be so, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.26. Where is now the safetie, which they promised themselues by their <hi>Horses</hi> and <hi>Chariots?</hi> I must againe say, <hi>Mendax equus ad salutem,</hi> A horse is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing for <hi>safetie,</hi> a vaine thing <hi>to saue</hi> a man. Thus is my doctrine confirmed;
<q>He that is mounted on horsebacke, hath no aduantage aboue others, for the sauing of himselfe, if God doe once resolue to punish.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let vs make some vse of this doctrine. It may first serue for <hi>reproofe</hi> of such, as for the time of warre doe glory in the multitude and strength of their <hi>horses,</hi> and presume that they shall preuaile and get the victory by the valour of their <hi>horsemen.</hi> The holy Scripture would haue them to be of an other minde, and to be perswaded, that victory is euer <hi>from the Lord,</hi> and <hi>from him alone,</hi> and that without him the <hi>horse</hi> and the <hi>rider</hi> can doe nothing. But they will not change their mind, they will not be thus perswaded. To these therefore thus saith the <hi>Lord God,</hi> the <hi>holy one of Israel, Esa.</hi> 30.15. <hi>In returning and rest shall yee be saued,</hi> in <hi>quietnes and confidence, shall be your strength; and ye would not.</hi> But ye said; <hi>No, for we will flee vpon horses, and will ride vpon the swift.</hi> Will you <hi>flee vpon horses?</hi> therefore shall <hi>yee flee.</hi> Will ye <hi>ride</hi> vpon the <hi>swift?</hi> therefore shall they that pursue you be <hi>swift.</hi> A <hi>thousand</hi> of you shall flee at the rebuke of <hi>one:</hi> or at the most <hi>at the rebuke of fiue</hi> shall ye flee <hi>till yee be left as a beacon vpon the top of a mountaine, and as an ensigne on a hill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against these there is a curse gone forth, <hi>Esa.</hi> 31.1. <hi>Woe be vnto them that goe downe to</hi> Egypt <hi>for helpe, and trust in</hi> horses, <hi>and comfort themselues with</hi> chariots, <hi>because they are many; and with</hi> horsemen, <hi>because they are lustie and strong: but looke not vnto the holy one of</hi> Israel, <hi>nor seeke the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning these I now say no more. I goe on with a second vse: and that is, to <hi>admonish</hi> our selues, that we put no trust, no confidence in <hi>horse, chariot, horsemen,</hi> or like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall meane for safetie. Sith it is euident, that these cannot deliuer vs, from any the least iudgement, that God in his displeasure shall lay vpon vs. Let vs for euer trust in the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:1741:185"/>
                     <hi>Lord</hi> alone, and his power. It is a sweete straine which the faithfull haue in their song, <hi>Psal.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Hi, curruum, &amp; illi equorum; nos vero nominis Iehovae Dei nostri recordamur.</hi> Let it be the matter of our meditation in the day of trouble and distresse. Say we in faith and a sure hope; <hi>Some trust in</hi> Chariots, <hi>and some in</hi> horses, <hi>but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</hi> We will remember him, to put our trust in him, and to settle our hope on him alone. So shall a blessing attend vs. It is promised, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.</hi> Blessed is he! What is that to say? It followeth: Hee shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that <hi>spreadeth out her rootes by the riuer,</hi> whom <hi>the heat,</hi> when it commeth, <hi>cannot hurt,</hi> whose <hi>leaues</hi> are alwayes <hi>greene,</hi> that is not carefull in the <hi>yeare of drought,</hi> and neuer ceaseth <hi>from yeelding fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this comparison betweene a <hi>faithfull man,</hi> that trusteth in the Lord, and a <hi>tree</hi> planted by the waters side, we may note the stedfastnesse and stabilitie wherewith the faithfull people of God are supported, so, that they can neuer <hi>fall away</hi> from faith, and from the grace of God: whereby is condemned the doctrine of <hi>doubting,</hi> that Popish doctrine, very pernicious, yea, deadly to euery soule, that shall drinke it in. But I will not here make any excursion. Let that which hath alreadie beene deliuered suffice for the explication of the 15. verse. The sixteenth followeth.</p>

                     <hi>hharom naked.</hi> A man is sometimes said to be <hi>naked,</hi> when he wanteth necessaries for the supply of present occasions. It is said of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.24. that he <hi>stript off his clothes,</hi> and <hi>prophecied,</hi> and <hi>was all that day and all that night naked.</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that <hi>Saul</hi> was indeed <hi>altogither naked,</hi> but he is said to be so, because he had <hi>laid aside</hi> his princely robes; as <hi>R. Chimchi</hi> thinketh; or because he had put off his militarie apparell, and was now as another common person, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> supposeth; or because he was <hi>sine pallio prophetico,</hi> because he had not on a Prophets cloake, as <hi>Drusius</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>obseruat. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 14.

                  <p>In the second of <hi>Samuel, chap.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Michal</hi> telleth <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he had vncouered himselfe, or made himselfe <hi>naked.</hi> And why? but because he had put of his princely apparell, and danced in a linnen <hi>Ephod.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Naked</hi> also may they be said to be, that haue no good apparell, no good clothing on. So are the Apostles said to be <hi>naked,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Euen to this present houre we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and haue no certaine dwelling place.</hi> VVe are <hi>naked,</hi> that is, saith <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,

                  <p>By the places now alleaged you see, that he may be said to be <hi>naked,</hi> that is not simply and altogither so.

I cannot better set forth vnto you the state of this <hi>day,</hi> then the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> doth, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.15. Read him, and you shall finde this <hi>day,</hi> the <hi>day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> to be <hi>a day</hi> of wrath, <hi>a day</hi> of trouble and distresse, <hi>a day</hi> of wastnesse and desolation, <hi>a day</hi> of darknesse and gloominesse, <hi>a day</hi> of clouds and thicke darknesse, <hi>a day</hi>

And so out of doubt it came to passe.</p>
                  <p>It came to passe in the dayes of <hi>Peka K.</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> at what time <hi>Tiglath Pilesar K.</hi> of <hi>Assyria</hi> came vp against the <hi>Israelites,</hi> tooke diuers of their Cities, the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that was beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> the possession of the <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Gadites, and halfe tribe of Manasseh,</hi> yea <hi>all the land of Nephthali:</hi> and <hi>carried some of their inhabitants captiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Assyria.</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 15.29.</p>
                  <p>After that in the dayes of <hi>Hoseah</hi> sonne of <hi>Elah,</hi> the last of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> this prediction was fulfilled, at what time <hi>Salmanasser King</hi> of <hi>Assyria</hi> invaded <hi>Israel,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the ten Tribes, tooke <hi>Samaria,</hi> and carried much people away into <hi>Assyria.</hi> Of this we read 2. <hi>King.</hi> 17.6.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>that day,</hi> that day when <hi>Tiglath Pilesar</hi> preuailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Israel,</hi> and that day wherein <hi>Salmanasser</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, he that was <hi>couragious among the mighty,</hi> was faine no doubt <hi>to runne away,</hi> and that <hi>naked,</hi> according to this prediction, <hi>He that is couragious among the mighty, shall flee away naked in that day.</hi> My obseruation from hence is this:
<q>It is not a stout courage, a valiant heart, or a bold spirit, <hi>that</hi> can steed a man in the day of Gods vengeance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:1741:187"/>
                  <p>Beleeue it, it is not. For in <hi>that day,</hi> the stoutest, the most valiant and bold, shall be striken with <hi>astonishment of heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28.29.</note> and shall grope at noone dayes, as the blind man doth in darkenesse. It shall then be with him, as it was with <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> the King, <hi>Daniel</hi> 5.6. <hi>His countenance shall bee changed,</hi> his <hi>thoughts shall trouble him,</hi> the <hi>ioynts of his loynes shall be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> and his <hi>knees shall smite one against the other.</hi> Yea then (for then will the <hi>Lord</hi> arise to <hi>shake terribly the earth</hi>) then shall he goe into the <hi>holes</hi> and <hi>clefts of the ragged rockes,</hi> and into the <hi>caues of the earth,</hi> for feare of <hi>the Lord, and for the glory of his Maiestie.</hi> So saith <hi>Esay</hi> elegantly, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.19, 21. And say you now, what can a <hi>stout courage,</hi> a valiant heart, a bold spirit steed a man in <hi>that day,</hi> in the day of Gods vengeance? You must needs confesse, it can steed him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Nothing! Let vs then for our good make some profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vse hereof. We shall the better make it if we will summe vp together those naturall abilities, which our Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> hath here disabled, from yeelding any helpe vnto vs in the day of God his reuengement: If neither he that is <hi>of an expedite and agile bodie,</hi> nor the <hi>strong man,</hi> nor the <hi>mightie man,</hi> nor the <hi>bow-man,</hi> nor the <hi>swift of foot,</hi> nor the <hi>horseman,</hi> shall in <hi>that day</hi> be able to <hi>deliuer</hi> or helpe <hi>himselfe:</hi> if he that is <hi>couragious among the mightie,</hi> shall be faine to <hi>runne away naked in that day,</hi> whence then shall we in <hi>that day</hi> looke for safetie? It must not be from any ayde of man.</p>
                  <p>Now the Vse we are to make hereof is, that we trust not in <hi>man,</hi> or in any thing that is in or about <hi>man.</hi> To this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie we are aduised by the Prophet <hi>Esai,</hi> chap. 2.22. <hi>Cease yee from</hi> man, <hi>whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> If you will be safe and without danger in the day of trouble, <hi>Cease from man;</hi> See that yee haue no <hi>confidence,</hi> no affiance in him, as though <hi>against</hi> God or <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> God he were able to <hi>helpe you.</hi> His <hi>breath is in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils;</hi> his soule, his vitall spirit, his life is but a blast, and is gone with a puffe. Then <hi>where is his helpe?</hi> Weake, fraile, and brittle <hi>man,</hi> wherein <hi>is he to be accounted of?</hi> Is he to be
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1741:188"/>
                     <hi>accounted of</hi> for any thing that is in him? for his <hi>actiuitie,</hi> for his <hi>dexteritie,</hi> for his <hi>valour,</hi> for his <hi>wisedome,</hi> or the like? No: for if he be <hi>gone,</hi> all these are likewise vanished.</p>
                  <p>But may he not be accounted of for somewhat that is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> him? for his <hi>riches,</hi> for his <hi>munition,</hi> and weapons of defence, for his <hi>honour,</hi> and the reputation he holdeth in the state wherein thou liuest? No, no. For what cares the <hi>Almightie</hi> for these? The <hi>Psalmist</hi> was not ill aduised, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146.3. Where he thus aduiseth vs: <hi>Put not your trust in</hi> Princes, <hi>nor in any sonne of</hi> man, <hi>in whom there is no helpe, his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts perish.</hi> See <hi>man</hi> here pictured and drawne forth in liuely colours: <hi>Put not your trust in Princes]</hi> not in <hi>Princes?</hi> Why? Is not their authoritie and pre-eminence here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great? Yes. But <hi>they are sonnes of men]</hi> Well. Be it so. The <hi>sonnes of men</hi> are creatures not farre inferiour to the <hi>Angels.</hi> True. But <hi>there is no helpe in them]</hi> no helpe in them? Why so? <hi>Their breath goeth forth]</hi> They <hi>dye.</hi> What if they <hi>dye?</hi> Is there no place for them in Heauen among the starres? No, they <hi>returne to their earth]</hi> there to participate with rottennesse and corruption. What if corruption be in their flesh, may not their intendments and deuises be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized and kept for eternitie? No, they may not. For <hi>in that very day their thoughts perish]</hi> their <hi>thoughts</hi> are as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie as their bodies, and come to nought. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>put not your trust</hi> in them; not <hi>in Princes,</hi> nor <hi>in any son of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein then shall we put our trust? Euen <hi>in the Lord our God.</hi> To this trust in the <hi>Lord,</hi> we are inuited, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.8, 9. <hi>It is botter to trust in the</hi> Lord <hi>then to put confidence in</hi> man. <hi>It is better to trust in the</hi> Lord, <hi>then to put confidence in</hi> Princes. Is one <hi>better</hi> then the other? Why, then both may be <hi>good,</hi> and it may be <hi>good</hi> to put confidence in man. Not so. You may not take the word <hi>better</hi> in this place to be so spoken. For if you put <hi>any confidence in man,</hi> you rob God of his glory; which to doe can neuer be <hi>good.</hi> I therefore thus expound the words: <hi>It is better]</hi> by infinite degrees,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:1741:188"/> absolutely and simply better, <hi>to trust in the Lord]</hi> to trust stedfastly in him alone, <hi>then to put any confidence]</hi> any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of trust or confidence, <hi>in man]</hi> of what estate or dignity soeuer he be, though he be of the rancke of <hi>Princes,</hi> who haue all the power and authoritie in the world. Its euery way <hi>better to trust in the Lord,</hi> then to trust in such, euer good to <hi>trust in the Lord,</hi> but neuer good to trust <hi>in man.</hi> Trust we <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and blessed shall we be: but cursed is the man that <hi>trusteth in man,</hi> and <hi>maketh flesh his arme;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath said it, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.5.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, O <hi>Lord,</hi> since thou hast from hence taught vs, that from the ayd of man there is no safetie to be expected, neither from him, that is <hi>of an expedite,</hi> and <hi>agile bodie,</hi> nor from <hi>the strong man,</hi> nor from <hi>the mightie man,</hi> nor from <hi>the bow-man,</hi> nor from <hi>the swift of foote,</hi> nor from <hi>the horseman,</hi> nor from the <hi>couragious among the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> nor from any thing else that is <hi>in</hi> man, or <hi>about</hi> him, giue vs grace we beseech thee, that in thee alone wee may place all our hope and confidence. In thee alone our God and Father of mercies doe we trust: and doe thou accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the multitude of thy compassions looke vpon vs. Heare the supplications of vs thy poore seruants, liuing far, as banished men in a sauage Countrey. Protect, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, and keepe our soules among the many dangers of this mortall life, and bring vs by the conduct of thy gracious fauour into that thy sacred habitation, and seate of eternall glory. Grant this vnto vs, most deare Father, for thy best beloued Sonne Iesus Christ his sake.</p>
